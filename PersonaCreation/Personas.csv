Structure- I felt like the conference would have been better if it had been flipped. The biggest socializing time was from Friday Afternoon-Saturday with the activities, dance, and service project time, and I would have liked to start with things like that so I could have had more time to get to know people and then spend the rest of the conference with them. As it was, it was really hard to meet people because the large events were at the end, and the break out session were splitting people up so much that I didn't feel I could really get to know people. Also, I wish the get to know you games were actually just unstructured time to mingle. I felt like I briefly met a lot of people but once again didn't have enough time to establish any real knowledge or acquaintance with anyone to take into the rest of the conference or beyond. It overall just felt like we had a lot of structured time, and not a lot of chances to meet with people, unless you somehow lucked out and ended up in a lot of events together.  2. I wouldn't say I would want a conference dividing the ages, but I wish there were times when the ysa were divided into those under and over twenty-five or something similar. It was nice to meet younger ysa, but I felt that I wanted to know more ysa at my age and place in life, and I struggled to find them. I wish there was a least one activity or time were it could have been divided more on age, so I could find them. "", 'Kansas city EFYSA put everyone in a group, and then the groups rotated.
