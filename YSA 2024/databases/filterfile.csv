67,R_1cGh2kuAyNwnChz,"I felt like the ysa committee members did an amazing job but it didnât seem to me like there were a lot of them & they were asked to do A LOT it seemed to me so maybe more helpers would have been beneficial.   The bathrooms got really really gross at times because of the amount of people using them. Having a plan for cleaning would be good such as having people sign up to help out.  Check in took a long time & we didnât get our lanyards/name tags until half way through. It was really nice to see peoples names & where they were from so it would be good to have those right at the start.   Sports & activities time in the schedule was not organized well & resulted in a large amount of downtime as there was no adequate space for everyone to play. Some people played sports in the parking lot & that wasnât a great idea in my opinion due to all the cars. Maybe tell participants to bring a game with them like Uno.   The church building was kind of small. I wonder if another building close by would have been bigger or could have been used for some activities.   There were periods of time in the schedule when there was too much down time. For example, we had way too much time at the Independence Visitors Center. Some of that is hard to predict but I think more opportunities to attend workshops would have been nice & shorter workshops like 30 min instead of 45 min.   The area broadcast was hard to watch, I got very sleepy. I would have rather seen someone in person than watch a broadcast. ",-1,1

I heard from a couple of people that they thought that part of it(on Saturday) was at the Birch church Building when all of it was at the church orchard. Maybe splitting the conference between two Saturdays/weekends is another suggestion because some people werenât able to attend during the day, Thursday or Friday, because of work. I took Thursday and Friday off from work so I was able to attend during the day but some people didnât attend much because they chose to work.

92,R_6qpXHxhQXJV7wO2,"The only two recommendations, and I mean the only recommendations (this conference was so good!!), that I have are 1) to suggest that text updates be used, rather than emails. Many of us were able to get the schedule through our emails, without any issues, but there was some confusion on the last day regarding where we were to meet, and this led to many of us being late to the morning devotional. If a text update had been sent out to participants, it would have helped resolve the confusion. 2) Though I stayed in my own apartment, I heard from one participant, that they had issues getting checked into their hotel. Apparently the hotel did not have their names on the reservation list. I don't know if this is an isolated incident, so I wanted to bring it up just in case it needed addressing.",-1,1

157,R_56QulXiNo2cwiOt,"A. For our conference we had almost the entire afternoon between lunch and dinner for free time, unless you attended the temple, which was great! I didn't feel rushed between activities and I wasn't overexerted or exhausted. However, I wish there were more structured and planned activities in that time for young adults to hang out and get to know one another--otherwise people tended to stay with who they knew, and what activities they created on their own. Suggestions for this time include: 1. A Game Room, with board and card games on purpose for young adults to play together, and a good way to get young adults to break up their groups. 2. Structured sports spaces and games. There was *eventually* but it came a little late in the conference to take advantage of it. With more notice I'm sure that the college campus hosting would be better prepared to let us use those spaces. 3. A list of places that young adults can explore in the town. Golden Colorado had a ton of beautiful hikes, free/cheap museums, and other places to explore, and some kind of suggestion list would have been handy for young adults to get together and explore (and get to know new people/go on dates maybe?)  2.

I thought it would help ysa to make more friends if there were more opportunities to meet in their small groups.

Also I don't know how you would make this better, but my brother and I live about an hour or hour and a half away, depending on traffic from where the conference was mainly held, so I emailed asking if we were eligible to stay in one of the provided hotels. I was sent back an email promptly stating we could, but upon concluding the first day my brother and I arrived at the hotel and were told they didn't have our name on the list of EFYSA who were given rooms. This was roughly 11:15pm, and we then traveled home and arrived home at 12:15am showered and we're asleep by 12:45am, however we were then woken up at 5:30am so that we could drive down with our mother on her way to work to save on gas, which meant my brother and I arrived at the birch building around 7am. And sue to significant brain trauma over the years I cannot go back to sleep after I have woken up, and if I get less than 5 hours of sleep have a highly increased chance of having seizure like episodes at any given moment of the day. So the second day of the conference was hard to enjoy as i was constantly twitching and worrying that I would have a full seizure like episode. And the only night my brother and I were able to spend in a hotel was the last night, after finding the two people who were in charge of housing and asking them what happened. So I know my situation is quite rare and strange, but I just think there needs to be sent a verification email along with a confirmation email for housing needs.",-1,2
176,R_6ASCWsji2AOIwwu,"1. Housing - I know housing was a little difficult and I know itâs always not an easy thing to work out, but I do think it wouldâve been easier if housing was available to every single person and we were all able to say in one location. Those who were local had to pay $50 but then had to pay a lot of gas money to drive to the location. Just like EFY and current FSY conferences, everyone is able to meet in one location and it just forms a nice spot to maybe have different roommates and actually have the opportunity to spend more time together. Here we had to just kind of go our separate ways at the end of the night and only a portion of everyone got to stay together.  2. Organization/Communication - They had general plans and we had a schedule, but some of the experiences seem kind of disorganized, and there was also some lack of communication that I think wouldâve been helpful. For example, the service project: all we were really told was to bring sunscreen and bug spray and wear white shirt and many people didnât even get that message. But we were in the woods and it wouldâve been helpful to be informed to wear long pants and socks since this area is prone to have ticks. Plus, no one had any idea what we were going to do for the service project until we got there. I know itâs good for everyone to be can be OK with a change of plans and going with the punches, because I do think that we really did our best to try to stick to the schedule and the timing of everything. And referring to communication, I feel like there were a lot of emails that we got. There was like a lot of reminders, and so sometimes it was kind of overwhelming, and we had to kind of search for what was relevant in the moment. The speaking to the schedule, I do feel like we shouldâve ended with our testimony meeting. We had a testimony meeting before we did the temple experience and I feel like there was some kind of missed opportunity to have testimonies based off of that since it was a very special and groundbreaking thing that we were able to do. Also, there was singing broken up between the testimony meeting, so really wasnât that long and not that many people were even able to bear their testimonies. I also feel like the talent show shouldâve been earlier in the weekend versus one of the last things we did.  3. Activities/Theme - I feel as though Think Celestial is a great theme, however, a good portion of our activities were really tied to going to church history sites and theyâre really wasnât a focus on what those places meant in the history that actually went down there. There were a lot of people who got to experience those places for the first time, and luckily Liberty Jail and the visitor center in Independence have a structured presentation, but the other two locations, Far West and Adam-Ondi-Ahman wasnât like that and it just seemed kind of random to go to those places. It just didnât seem like it was on theme with Think Celestial because there wasnât any devotional or discussion really about the significance of these locations.  I honestly wouldâve loved it if we were able to do all the breakout rooms. They had up to six options, but we were only able to go to two because of the time. I wish that we couldâve been able to all gone to each one if they broke it off into days to hear all the messages. I kind of feel like I was missing out on the other breakout room options because I only had time for two.  I feel like there could have been  more fun activities where we couldâve all done together and been able to mingle better, maybe going to a baseball game couldâve been a fun opportunity for everyone. I think it was kind of hard to mingle at the end of the day which again I think if everyone was in the same housing situation couldâve helped as well. 4. Reverence - We used a stake center for the location for almost everything that we did for this weekend. And it seemed to be with all the people, hard to remember that the chapel is supposed to be reverent, even if itâs not on a Sunday. So I feel like there were just moments where it was at a place to cheer it to clap while we were in, the chapel and there was no reminder try to remember that, especially when we were doing our devotionals. The biggest thing, we had a firework show in the night time, and our location was right next to the temple. The firework show started when there was still a session happening in the temple, and to be honest, that wasnât appropriate to do. Many workers and patrons have already voiced how difficult was to focus because they heard very loud noises that first thought was thunder. I think fireworks are fun, but it should not have been that close to the temple. I know there was an idea that was put around to do lanterns, and I think that shouldâve been the route we shouldâve taken. We couldâve written a little testimony on them or any thoughts after pondering and I couldâve been a really cool bonding experience to light them and let them float away, especially since the all night temple experience had started during the firework display. I feel like we shouldâve ended on a more spiritual and reverent note than fireworks. ",-1,0

I really don't think anyone will truly read my survey. I've been a single for a long time. I know what works and what doesn't for these activities. There need to be better social setting where singles can talk or learn to meet new people. To be open to dating people with good standards. It's not forced its just when you have good activities a long with spiritual than it helps the singles more. As a man I honestly think the world tries to divide young singles. Women don't respect guys as much. What it means to be a future father to provide protect. Many people are selfish in there indevers to meet people. Society tell women you don't need men. We need to be taught the importance in these confrnce for one another and God's plan of happiness. We use apps to swipe instead of getting to know people. Need to put forth a better environment that's fun that forces young singles to talk and recognize the value of a good man and women in the church. There are lots of ideas.

It would be better is everyone had housing. Going back and forth was difficult. The stake center was too small - it was hard to socialize if your free time. It was also hard to do the activities like the dance or sports time.  Include more fun things - I like being spiritual but people also was to connect with others while doing something fun.

Between not knowing which classes were at what time, not having instagram or GroupMe for the first day, and the fact that classes were in a different bldg, we were usually late to class, and classes already felt pressed for time.  Don't provide candy. We're not teenagers. If we want candy, we can buy candy. Put that money towards more food. There were some people who left dinner feeling hungry, not because they arrived late, but because they were allowed small portions of food so everyone could get firsts, and then when they went back for seconds there was little left, and they resorted to the cupcakes/candy which were in endless supply.  If you house the participants on campus again, recommend they bring their own bedding. The pillows were flat, the mattresses very uncomfortable, and some blankets very thin.  Not a necessity, but it would have been nice to have some recommendations for things to do in Golden-hikes, museums, activities to do during free time.  I see no need for the name tags and special lanyards. The only info I used from them were the group numbers, which I feel could have just been communicated in an email. People need to go up to each other and ask their names. Having a name tag is a crutch and can make it awkward for introductions.  Keep the testimony meetings an hour or less.

This conference also did feel pretty full of young YSA. At 25, I felt surprisingly old (my ward is full of people who are in their late 20s).  I didnât love having the morning side devotional hosted by the same person everyday, maybe because his teaching style didnât resonate with me. Would have preferred more variety. It felt just like being in Sunday school for four days in a row, instead of being an exceptional learning experience (I will admit this could have been a personal attitude problem, but still would have liked a different speaker each morning.

There was another lesson where it was a panel of women and they told the women that you can be a mother and have a full time career if you manage your time right. I felt like all the teachers had their lessons posited on some feminist ideologies. I had the impression that the whole thing was some kind of girls camp and there was nothing for the men. There was some confusion at the men's lesson and there were about the same amount of women there as men and the teacher said he would make his lesson more tailored for everyone.

Free time (more organization or structure on this one, I kinda felt like it turned into just to do whatever you want, which I'm not against at all it worked but I worry for those that don't have friends there or not feeling included maybe at those times.), Service project was very disorganized with so many different people in charge. It worked out in the end, but I could go on and on about how many different things that happend making everyone confused throughout the whole process and slowed things down a bit.  I never really used my efysa card that had my group number on it. A small card printed on paper wouldn't done fine, but I might keep it for memories I suppose. Just thinking about cost ð¤·  Last day the devotional was at 9am but lots of ysa still running around trying to get checked out, a long line to sign out.   Protein at meals was very limited to 2 or 3oz at most, but everything tastes great and I'm super grateful! Just kinda felt off I guess  Maybe a suggested curfew or some other way of saying it.  I don't think they're should be loud people at 4:30am in the morning and hearing girls in the guys building at that time.

Though weâre young and have much to learn, many of us have served missions, lived around the world, graduated from higher education, have started careers, etc. I noticed a lot of emphasis on things like social skills, (which are good reminders and may be new ideas for some) that I found slightly patronizing.

Having some classes in the evening so that people who have to work during the day can have that experience.  The service project at the orchard was a bit chaotic. if we all could have met at the birch building and carpooled from there parking would not have been so bad. also having teams and a verbal goal of what and where we are trying to reach for thinning peaches would have allowed us to work more efficiently.

495,R_5HyQyuRsrmXnQfn,"The session director came up to my group asking for feedback and many of us said our favorite part was the freedom of getting to choose who we met, hung out with, and what activities we spent the day doing. He said he heard a lot of similar answers but also some different answers where people reported they felt it was harder to meet people and would have preferred more structured groups and activities to allow them an easier time meeting people. The director asked if we had any ideas on how to solve this disparity, since he valued and wanted to maintain the freedom some found so helpful, and he also wished to help those who felt less comfortable reaching out to people with the lax structure. At the time, I didnât have any ideas but I do have one now! I think for future conferences, there should be an option during the signup process where people can select if they would prefer to be put into a more structured group that will meet together consistently with others who chose that option; or if they would prefer to be in groups that have more freedom. You could even do a range of options like 1. Mostly structured, 2. Partially structured, and 3. Unstructured. I believe this would allow each individual to pick the most comfortable, helpful, and fun promoting option for THEM and not force anyone into a style of conference they wouldnât love. The groups can of course interact with each other, and people wouldnât have to be separated based on their choice, but it would allow for people who prefer to be grouped together to have that option. Based on how many people choose each option during their signup, you can organize people into according groups and make certain structural preparations for those who would rather be in a consistent group to help the meet and bond with others. I think the flexibility and agency of this idea would function really well!  A shorter suggestion involves whoever taught the class on finding your future spouse. To put it bluntly he was a horrible teacher. He took the opportunity of teaching the class to trash talk his wife continuously and do his best to discourage people from getting married. It seemed the intention of his message was âlife is hard, marriage is hard and takes a lot of work, but itâs worth it.â EXCEPT he never got to the part about any of his complaints being worth it. He didnât say one positive thing about his wife or marriage the whole time, didnât really offer any helpful insight on finding a spouse, and didnât seem to offer any kind of helpful information to many people I talked to. I donât wish to only complain but the content of the lesson was shockingly bad and I donât see how he would have helped anyone. An alternate recommendation for next time would be Brother Goss from Colorado Springs. He taught marriage related lessons at FSY when I was there in 2022. I personally loved his lessons and heard only amazing feedback from anyone else who attended.

There was a lot of unstructured time during the day when it was tough to figure out what to do, and many others including myself would've appreciated having structured activities during this time.  This especially includes the evenings after devotional, since I didn't know too many other people there to hang out with and was unsure what to do, so I just went to bed way earlier than I normally do.  Maybe spending some time in our groups for longer, especially during these unstructured times, would be nice to encourage getting to know other people and spending time together. In addition, lots of the classes weren't exactly what the topics were.  It was cool to see the titles of many topics of young adult life relating to thinking celestial, but only one of these classes I attended actually tied these together.  The rest completely avoided thinking celestial until the very end in the speaker's testimony.

525,R_6PTqYnbeG3uCbft,"1) The biggest way these conferences can be improved, both from Nauvoo 2023 and Denver 2024, is MORE GROUP ACTIVITIES. Last year in Nauvoo, so many people were walking around alone because they didn't have a group to do things with, like tour historic sites. Yes we had groups, but they didn't organize anything for our free time. In Denver this year, I would have liked to have more group activities like EFY or like Nauvoo last year. End our day with group reflection. Do group get to know you activities. The only time we got together in groups was for testimony meeting. After testimony meeting, everyone said they wish we would have met our groups sooner. I did like how this year groups were by age, so 31 year olds weren't with 18 year olds. Even though I am local to Denver, I didn't have many friends there. I found myself wandering alone at times, wishing I had a group I could be with. For free time, nightime activities, the activities during our non-temple day, during our dance. Lots of people went there alone wanting to meet people, and they mostly stayed alone because there were no groups. There were also girls and people I wanted to meet, but they were with their group or friends the entire time so it was hard. Assigned groups splits up existing friend groups and forces everyone to meet new people.  2) Better communication beforehand. I realize this was the first conference of it's kind and there was a lot to workout. But we didn't receive much communication until about a week before the conference, which would have made traveling hard if I wasn't local. When I registered it sounded like only people from far away would get to use the dorms. Then later it said everyone could use the dorms. Signing up for the temple was also not communicated well. At one point I was sent an email with a Google Form to sign up for the day and time I was going to the temple, but I didn't even know the conference schedule yet. Then in the end, we got assigned a day.  3) Communication during the conference. The GroupMe was great! However, some things were not clear. Like which classes were which day, where they were located, and how to get to those buildings. After our morningside devotional we were dismissed to go to our classes. Apparently the class options were posted on instagram, but I don't have Instagram. No announcement was made about what the classes were or how to get to them. Also it wasn't clear what day I was supposed to go to the temple. I knew my group number, but not which day that group number was supposed to go. ",-1,2

For the dance, the instruction was super fun! But the dance itself was not. The music couldâve been adjusted to better accommodate for our taste.

It was better on Friday when there were more places to split off to. Either inviting more speakers to utilize more building every day, or looking at chapels that don't need a left-hand turn to drive to would help a lot.

There were some participants that didnât see a single site or show at Nauvoo because they felt like they needed to be at the conference. Nauvoo is pretty remarkable all on its own without a single class or activity.   The speed friending was really poorly organized. It was too loud and it hurt my head about 5 people in. It was a really fun idea that could have been executed so much better had you split people up into different rooms or even different tables.,-1,2

I also think a different location would be nice where we donât have to drive all over town. It made traffic terrible for everyone, parking was a nightmare, and it made us late sometimes.

Part of it is the nature of the 'Inn' vs. the Villas, but it's clear I would have enjoyed the Inn more than the Villas.   If the bus route is already a part of Nauvoo, getting the bus schedule and planning the conference around that may help. I could just drive myself (despite not really wanting to), but found that I couldn't reliably time the buses.  There was a lot of 'grouping' that happened at the conference I attended. Many came in various groups, or with their own significant others.

The biggest socializing time was from Friday Afternoon-Saturday with the activities, dance, and service project time, and I would have liked to start with things like that so I could have had more time to get to know people and then spend the rest of the conference with them. As it was, it was really hard to meet people because the large events were at the end, and the break out session were splitting people up so much that I didn't feel I could really get to know people. Also, I wish the get to know you games were actually just unstructured time to mingle. I felt like I briefly met a lot of people but once again didn't have enough time to establish any real knowledge or acquaintance with anyone to take into the rest of the conference or beyond. It overall just felt like we had a lot of structured time, and not a lot of chances to meet with people, unless you somehow lucked out and ended up in a lot of events together.  2. I wouldn't say I would want a conference dividing the ages, but I wish there were times when the ysa were divided into those under and over twenty-five or something similar. It was nice to meet younger ysa, but I felt that I wanted to know more ysa at my age and place in life, and I struggled to find them.

Two, A Speed date and actually talk about dating ( I understand it is a hard topic however in the Idaho Falls Area it isn't pushed that much it should be more its a commandment to try in this life to date and be married)   Three, Get to know you games before the Keynote Speaker there was a good amount of time after checking in that could have been used for more things. One I would say a lot of Elders from my quorum would have attended if there were a little bit of video games involved if that Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Jack box games. This would have been great to get to know people a little more.   Four. They should have Done a 5k or 3k we have an amazing greenbelt, that follows the Snake River and goes to the Temple and the weather was perfect in the morning we could have started at the Event Center go to the Temple or church by the temple and then back. Then have a nice savory hearty breakfast made by staff, volunteers (Stake Presidents, other available members of the stake) this would be great to get to know more YSA members overall.   5th.Testimony meeting was great, but I think it should have been saved for the last day or night and switched with the concert and dance to help keep that spirit into the next day to prepare our hearts and mind to service.   6. A little more activity then Heise a lot of people weren't able to do zip lining because a lot of people signed put for zip lining and swimming both days, so some didn't get to enjoy Heise. Got some bowling or Fat Cats Miniature Golf. Rope Course. Just extra things to be doing.   I know there is a lot but being a local here there were so many missed opportunities for things that could have happened with part of this Conference. I did truly enjoy it and needed that with working so much I need to have an added moment of more social interaction.

I don't need to sing and dance to lame EFY songs. I don't need to be forced to slow dance with a boy. I don't need to be monitored by ""adult"" leadership. Second: I AM AN ADULT WITH A JOB. It is insane to expect working professionals to be available all day on weekdays. Move this to a Friday night through Sunday event. Third: PUT ACTUAL YSA IN CHARGE. We had 7 people on the Idaho Falls committee, and most were from the exact same ward. There should be a representative from every single ward that will be involved that serves on the committee. The committee should be headed by a male and female YSA, not by an out of touch married couple that overrides everything. Fourth: SEPARATE OUT AGES. Again, I am 30 years old. I have no interest in hanging out with 18 year olds. Separate these conferences into 18-25 and 26-35 sections so we actually have a chance of making friends and finding people to date. Fifth: GET SPEAKERS WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND US. It is unbelievably ridiculous to be told that we ""just need to go to institute to get married."" These speakers should be people who can actually relate to our life situations and not just talk down to us or talk about things completely unhelpful to the reality of our lives. In short, these speakers should be relatable and talk about JESUS. I don't need a how to on dating, I need my Savior. SIXTH: The scheduling in Idaho Falls was crazy. They didn't give us addresses, they were unclear on timing, and they made us drive around the entire city (and into other cities) for the various events. This should be centralized far better. I came into this conference so hopeful, and I left extremely disappointed and feeling like I am old, don't belong anywhere in the Church, and have no hope of progressing in life.",-1,1

818,R_3roa3byO4eyKFR7,"A more unified theme! It would be cool if the devotionals tied into a theme more obviously. And more structured opportunities for spiritual reflection, like hey we're all going to journal/ponder for 30 min about x topic or something.  A shorter variety show.... it was too long (and I say that as someone who was in it!!)  Speed friending was awesome but 30 seconds was too short and it was so loud you had to yell to hear. 3 min would be better. I didn't actually continue talking to almost anyone I met a speed friending.  Not a recommendation but I feel like there was a sense of trying to meet as many new people up to the very end. But by 36 hours in, I was more wanting to make deeper connections with people I already met. But not everyone felt the same way.  Get Connor Price and 100Graham for a concert!  If we're going to be in Nauvoo, I wish the conference had a more obvious tie-in to Nauvoo, that it was mentioned more in the devotionals and such.  Put more things in writing! Make a schedule that's easier to read! I have lots of ideas on logistics. Tell us what the service project is in advance, and also how long the run/walk will be. None of that was publicly announced.  More info about the speakers and activities/opportunities in the opening session. The info was sort of scattered and some quick intros, sort of like an orientation, would be helpful when deciding how to spend time the next few days.  Fewer line dances.  Something to cater to or account for the 25+ split? Happy to meet everyone, but I'm not trying to date someone who just graduated high school.

823,R_62M5coA1nfmXudb,"I have a few.  1. We were encouraged to carpool, but I, as well as many others, signed up for the conference alone. I was the only one from my ward that went. This made it difficult to find rides, especially for the first day. I have two possible solutions for this. One would be to have participants sign up to be a carpool driver during the registration process, these volunteers could be identified via a different colored lanyard so that participants without rides can locate/approach them easily. I have no problem asking for rides, but it was difficult finding someone who actually had space, I usually ended up asking at least five people before I found a ride. A second possibility would be to have participants join specific group me chats for the destinations/events that they plan attend at the beginning of the conference so that they can plan out their rides for the week in advance with people going to the same place as them.   2. The conference was great, but something that I noticed was that our schedules were packed from 9:00AM to at least 9:00PM each day. By day two, people were tired, especially because almost everyone had a 30 min+ drive to and from the Mountain America Center. My suggestion is that the activities end earlier so that people can leave without feeling like they're missing out and the YSA that still have energy can have opportunities to do unplanned activities with those they have met at the conference.  3. There were a lot of people, myself included, that were not as outgoing. I would love to see more activities that allow the participants to meet new friends. Possible ideas are get to know you games(which were played for 30 minutes of the first night), speed dating, team games/competitions, or anything where we need to work together. The service project was a great example of being in a group working together and getting to know each other.",-1,1

832,R_67UvhhsficQFuBM,"I have a few ideas to make the conference better!  1. Don't bring Brandon Sanderson back or Heather Farrell. Brandon Sanderson is someone I really dislike because of many reasons, but his books are very dark and focus too much on evil/antichrists/false prophets, hi talk turned to just be about himself and how he was so awesome for being rich, and several other topics that I didn't feel comfortable. He wasn't the worst, but I would have just checked into the conference, and then left next time. Heather Farrell made her talk really uncomfortable for talking and dwelling on sexual topics and stories from the Bible that took away from the spirit. I also think that since she had just had a baby 3 weeks ago, that she should have been able to be tending to herself and her newborn child. 2. The only talks I heard speak on thinking celestial was brother Chang, sister eubank, and the d'evegnÃ©es. Maybe if the other talks were screened more thoroughly, the topic would have been more heavily focused on and the spirit could have been just that much more powerful. 3. I would have loved to have heard from the couple that were the head of the conference. 4. Less driving would have been very nice. If we had had 3 stake centers close by to each other, I would have felt much more safe, or even if I had parked at the MAC and then been shuttled, there would have been less confusion, less danger for the crazy numbers on the road, and our car wouldn't have been backed into so severely (everything was taken care of peacefully and with the spirit present, but it didn't have to happen) 5. It's a small thing, but not having ribs would just be a better thought for our bodies and also financially.  But honestly, all in all, it was a good conference and I really enjoyed the time I spent!",1,0
833,R_6PuErknSSENagFR,One thing that I would recommend is maybe splitting the age groups up just a little bit so that you can know who is actually your age! One way this could be accomplished is during testimony meeting you could spilt it up like okay 18-20 year olds whose last name starts with A-H go to this room and so on and so forth.  I honestly think that just splitting up age groups for all of is would be awesome because guys would come up and talk to me and ask me for my number and I'd ask for their age and they'd be in their 30's where I am only 18.,1,1

I think I would have enjoyed the concert if it hadn't been so loud, but I know that's how concerts normally are. I hung out with some other YSAs outside during the concert, and that was a good time.

As a slightly older YSA, I felt it could have been catered better to an older audience and didnât love feeling like I was a teenager at FSY again. This applied to the session director and the dance.   I also felt, and heard multiple people say, that it felt like a theme of the conference was that no one knew what was going on. Some things werenât communicated super well, or we werenât sure what was going on or where some things were. Overall it was amazing, but there were at least a few things each day, like the bus schedule, what was happening the last day, where the concert was, and what building we were staying in, that we kind of had to figure out with little information.   Classes were also scheduled back to back without, it seems, teachers being told to make them 50 minutes so there was a break to get to another class.

948,R_61T28Z4xwALpI1G,"I have several recommendations to make the conference better. Some of it has to do with my age (I am 30), some of it has to to with some general observations. They're opinions of course, but I share them with the intent to be helpful.  It seemed that the age of the conference-goers skewed younger. That is not the fault of the conference per se, but I would have loved to have had more opportunities to mingle with young adults more so my age. I talked someone in the stake presidency of Nauvoo (Bro. Seamen) and he told me that they are piloting a program where the YSA conference breaks out into age brackets. I think something like that would be helpful to reach out to the older young single adults who are still in that YSA range. For example, I felt that the dances did not particularly resonate with me. Again, I acknowledge that it seems that most of the conference goers were younger, but I admit that I felt a little out of place at times.  The variety show lasted far too long. I feel bad for those performers who had to compete with the restless crowd and dinner.  Mote get-to-know-you activities  There was a snafu with the buses that I'm sure you are all aware. I took it in stride and made the most of it and acknowledge that some things can't be foreseen, but I encourage more logistical planning if such is needed.  I've never attended fsy, but I have heard that last year's experience definitely had a fsy feel. I'm glad that this conference this year had less of an fsy feel. I suppose it depends on who your target audience is. Once again, as an older ysa, I felt a little out of place. I would love to see some tweaking be done to reach out to older ysas.  Please do not schedule a devotional before a dance. For me, it disrupted the pacing of the devotional. People were trying to get set up for the dance and I found it distracting.

Most talked about the Gospel and brought in scriptures and examples... But the ones I attended didn't ever testify of Christ or have Him be the center of the discussion. It was about the sacrament table but not Christ's a toning sacrifice. It was about changing your thinking habits and the science behind it but not about leaning on the Savior for help through it (that one they mentioned more about the fact that they were working on publishing their findings than about Christ). I really needed to learn of my Savior in a way that aimed only for YSA. It was the one time to have only one demographic in an area to speak of Christ, rejoice of Christ, and it felt like every speaker took away from Christ and focused on the imperfections of how we are worshiping and how they think we can change it, again without Christ. Not that they avoided the topic for they used scriptures and all ended in His name but that was it. I left feeling further from my Savior then when I started. I had gone to the Boise one and it had been a great experience where each lecture had been about the Savior and His example or testimony or teaching and so I was so excited to come to this one.
