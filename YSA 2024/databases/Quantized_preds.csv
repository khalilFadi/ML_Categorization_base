But I do think the last one he presented I was just a little bit surprised that it was just a big focus on going to Institute. As someone who is going to Institute already, it just seemed kind of not as inspirational. It was great to see the blessings of institute that I have seen in my life, but it just didnât seem as general maybe. Itâs probably just because I feel like Institute isnât forever so I feel like there could be other things that we couldâve focused as well as Institute that can benefit our lives. ",Average,"I do think it couldâve been beneficial to have some kind of breakfast items as well, especially the day after we did our all night temple experience. People just didnât really get a lot of sleep and I think it couldâve been beneficial if there was some kind of small breakfast items already there so people didnât have to worry about eating breakfast. There was one dinner that was really exceptional, that was catered in Polynesian food, it was a really great food that was provided by members so that was awesome to see. But I think for the lunches too they had a lot of sandwiches to provide for the first few days, which made sense but got old a little bit and they ended up having extra and just leaving them out instead of refrigerating them ","The highlights for me was definitely the all Night temple experience. Another one was the Polynesian dancers who performed for us. That was a really amazing experience to see different cultures. And then the breakout rooms are really structured, and the prisoners that at least I was able to attend were really well prepared and has such a great message to share and was relevant to the YSA.","I think it was a miracle that spots filled up so much to attend the temple all night as well as so many workers also offered to serve so I could be able to do all the sessions that we could do. It was really cool to walk out the temple at night and see people on the grounds just waiting to come in, it was a really special spirit out on temple grounds that night/early morning.",,,"1. Housing - I know housing was a little difficult and I know itâs always not an easy thing to work out, but I do think it wouldâve been easier if housing was available to every single person and we were all able to say in one location. Those who were local had to pay $50 but then had to pay a lot of gas money to drive to the location. Just like EFY and current FSY conferences, everyone is able to meet in one location and it just forms a nice spot to maybe have different roommates and actually have the opportunity to spend more time together. Here we had to just kind of go our separate ways at the end of the night and only a portion of everyone got to stay together.  2. Organization/Communication - They had general plans and we had a schedule, but some of the experiences seem kind of disorganized, and there was also some lack of communication that I think wouldâve been helpful. For example, the service project: all we were really told was to bring sunscreen and bug spray and wear white shirt and many people didnât even get that message. But we were in the woods and it wouldâve been helpful to be informed to wear long pants and socks since this area is prone to have ticks. Plus, no one had any idea what we were going to do for the service project until we got there. I know itâs good for everyone to be can be OK with a change of plans and going with the punches, because I do think that we really did our best to try to stick to the schedule and the timing of everything. And referring to communication, I feel like there were a lot of emails that we got. There was like a lot of reminders, and so sometimes it was kind of overwhelming, and we had to kind of search for what was relevant in the moment. The speaking to the schedule, I do feel like we shouldâve ended with our testimony meeting. We had a testimony meeting before we did the temple experience and I feel like there was some kind of missed opportunity to have testimonies based off of that since it was a very special and groundbreaking thing that we were able to do. Also, there was singing broken up between the testimony meeting, so really wasnât that long and not that many people were even able to bear their testimonies. I also feel like the talent show shouldâve been earlier in the weekend versus one of the last things we did.  3. Activities/Theme - I feel as though Think Celestial is a great theme, however, a good portion of our activities were really tied to going to church history sites and theyâre really wasnât a focus on what those places meant in the history that actually went down there. There were a lot of people who got to experience those places for the first time, and luckily Liberty Jail and the visitor center in Independence have a structured presentation, but the other two locations, Far West and Adam-Ondi-Ahman wasnât like that and it just seemed kind of random to go to those places. It just didnât seem like it was on theme with Think Celestial because there wasnât any devotional or discussion really about the significance of these locations.  I honestly wouldâve loved it if we were able to do all the breakout rooms. They had up to six options, but we were only able to go to two because of the time. I wish that we couldâve been able to all gone to each one if they broke it off into days to hear all the messages. I kind of feel like I was missing out on the other breakout room options because I only had time for two.  I feel like there could have been  more fun activities where we couldâve all done together and been able to mingle better, maybe going to a baseball game couldâve been a fun opportunity for everyone. I think it was kind of hard to mingle at the end of the day which again I think if everyone was in the same housing situation couldâve helped as well. 4. Reverence - We used a stake center for the location for almost everything that we did for this weekend. And it seemed to be with all the people, hard to remember that the chapel is supposed to be reverent, even if itâs not on a Sunday. So I feel like there were just moments where it was at a place to cheer it to clap while we were in, the chapel and there was no reminder try to remember that, especially when we were doing our devotionals. The biggest thing, we had a firework show in the night time, and our location was right next to the temple. The firework show started when there was still a session happening in the temple, and to be honest, that wasnât appropriate to do. Many workers and patrons have already voiced how difficult was to focus because they heard very loud noises that first thought was thunder. I think fireworks are fun, but it should not have been that close to the temple. I know there was an idea that was put around to do lanterns, and I think that shouldâve been the route we shouldâve taken. We couldâve written a little testimony on them or any thoughts after pondering and I couldâve been a really cool bonding experience to light them and let them float away, especially since the all night temple experience had started during the firework display. I feel like we shouldâve ended on a more spiritual and reverent note than fireworks. ",Female,26.0,Leavenworth,Kansas,"1.

They had one republic, a dance. They had a lot more fun activities and ways for people to get to know each other. My thing is were adults. It's not fsy. There needs to be older ysa helping with the activities. The seventy had a lot of energy and loved us, but I don't think tge people that ran this know how hard it is to date lds people now. I want to be spiritually uplifted. The dance was not planned out well and that is one of the best ways ysa members get to know each other. I think there needs to be a sense of getting to know others more. There needs to be a better balance of spirituality and the social. As an older ysa member that's studied dating friendships etc. A lot of us don't even know how to socialize and communicate well. We need help. We need some confidence. Mixing better fun activities a long with testimony meetings etc will help.  I was In a comfrence in utah where a therapist spoke through fireside about socializing a d dating. He pointed out these activities are for all ages and helping people as well know it's OK to be open to dating. There is a grass is greener mentality and in the last days there's no commitment. The counselors told us. If you 18 ans feel like you don't want to date socialize because your going on a mission this is for you. If your in and out of byu 20 to 24 and feel you don't know if you have the time to date make friends and socialize. This message is for you. If your 25 to 30 and feel your done and tired of socializing trying to meet people. This message us for you. It's the same message that leaders may not understand either. Young single adults need to recognize at these activities that there are good single adults out there. That we need to strive to be around worthy lds singles. Thinking celestial allows us to be open to socializing, dating meeting people. To be open regardless of the other things we have going in our lives. This is something that the church needs to teach in these activities possibly to be open to eventually getting out of a singles ward. We're loved regardless, but we need to be open to God's future plans for us. He created singles wards to help with us being able to have callings, but it's so we can confidently be open with a wide net of opetunity to socially meeting others. It's that ysa members of shut themselves out.   If you look at where your having these church ysa conferences as well. It's where there aren't as many members unless your going to boise idaho, or utah. These activities should be built to help us prepare for the future in the church. Right now singles refuse to be open to meeting the opposite sex. Somethings got to eventually change in the church to help more. The confeence can be made better  to help with that. ",Good,It was good. ,"Would of been better to have a longer dance. That's where singles most of the time meet. I just think that unfortunately the people that help don't know much about lds social scene. If they just had a dance and allowed a mixture of line dances and different songs it's help. The huge ysa confrence in utah where there were thousands of singles attending didn't quite get it either. It was like a rave. The same instance with this dance. They taught us a weird Belgian dance that most people really didn't want to do for over and hour. Let's just dance. The fire alarm went off after short period of time and left not time for socializing.  I'm being honest if your going to really hold these activities you need fun experienced older ysa member to help that know what it's like. In the church they made a change to have young ysa members as counselors in ysa bishop bricks. It was announced by the church. It was inspired because I've been in singles wards for years and can tell you adults in the church that got married young even the 70 there really don't get it. I can throw stats on how difficult it is to date and socialize, but you guys need fun experienced people. Some of the younger singles helping out were kind of controlling in a bad way. I've experienced for instance in boise idaho where there are fun experienced ysa members that if asked to help the numbers would be 2 times as big and it would be a better more spiritual event. Please be open to change things. It's not to hurt feelings, but I think we need maybe even recently married or older ysa members to help. They know what the scene is. They know how to relate and make the activities better. Dance is a huge part. ","I wish I could say I did. I'm an older ysa member and it gets depressing to see how much worse basic social scenes are in the church. I respect what you guys are doing. Not trying to be critical. The church needs to really use spiritual and social to help kids more. If you don't understand our social delemas than it's hard to fix the spiritual. I'm trying to be respectful, but be truthful. The Elder that spoke I'd like him to look at my survey and be open to realize that he got married young in a time when marriage was a possitive thing and everyone did it young. It is now not a possitive thing. I'd make it possitive, be singles are not open to socializing and trying to date more. Hence a person could stay in the same boat for years a lone. I feel bad seeing the 70 speak at the end of the confrence thinking man your very happy, but you really don't get that God blessed him to get married young. He can't relate at all what it's like to be single and wait. The spiritual helps a little, but it's hard hearing counsel from people that simply don't understand the scene. I'm an attractive guy and have worked very hard to soclize. I wish these confrences could understand that working on the spiritual helps, but most ysa members continue to remain comfortable putting forth no effort to meet people and be single. It's caused some good people like me that could help more in the church have to wait and be a lone. I have the skills because I lived the gospel. I didn't put off opertunities to meet people and get married. It's hard hearing counsel from people that got married and had it easier. Time would be better spent teaching and helping single improve social skills and that finding a good lds and good lds girl is above all other things. In the church. Society teaches us not to want kids, not to get married. You have women on dating apps that statically only find top 10 percent of men attractive. This is what we're dealing with. You have no clue. Please study and try to help so some people can have changes of hearts to value good men and women in the church that fulfill there covenants. None of the singles realize how important it is. ",,,"I've already mentioned. You need more older experienced fun young singles that know how to make a good dance. That know fun activities that locally might know more people that can attend. Helping kids with activities where they can socialize as much as the spiritual part. I really don't think anyone will truly read my survey. I've been a single for a long time. I know what works and what doesn't for these activities. There need to be better social setting where singles can talk or learn to meet new people. To be open to dating people with good standards. It's not forced its just when you have good activities a long with spiritual than it helps the singles more. As a man I honestly think the world tries to divide young singles. Women don't respect guys as much. What it means to be a future father to provide protect. Many people are selfish in there indevers to meet people. Society tell women you don't need men.

The service project on Saturday 2. Testimony meeting on Friday 3. Getting to attend the temple on both days (and receiving my own endowment on the second!),"1. On Thursday I tried wearing a dress I hadn't before which didn't fit right and definitely needed an undershirt.  I did not have an undershirt with me.  Luckily (in my opinion by divine design) one of my new friends on the same floor was in the bathroom at that time and was able to give me an undershirt to borrow for the day.  Definitely a miracle for me since I had no other Sunday clothes to wear and was going to the temple baptistry where I'd be wearing my Sunday clothes for a while. 2. Not exactly a miracle, but I received many promptings to read my patriarchal blessing throughout the week that were reaffirmed multiple times while at EFYSA and while at the temple.  I then brought my patriarchal blessing to the conference Friday night and while I didn't know exactly why I should read it (and still don't exactly), I was able to read and feel the Spirit.  Some ways patriarchal blessings were mentioned: in one of the classes, in two of the testimonies, in the temple on Friday, and more times. 3. Another thing by divine design - I met a guy named Demario in one of my classes where we had time to introduce ourselves to someone random in the room.  When testimony meeting started, Demario walked in the room and I realized we were in the same group!  He bore a really sweet testimony, and after the meeting we were able to chat.  He was wondering what patriarchal blessings were, and I helped explain to him and suggested he should look into them more!  Definitely another instance of divine design, also playing into the prior miracle.",,,"It seemed like a lot of the conference was thrown together at the last minute.

",Exceptional,"In Nauvoo in 2023, we ran out of food and were often hungry. This year there was plenty of food for firsts and seconds, and some snacks too. Breakfast was excellent in the dorm hall, Chik-Fil-A lunch was excellent, and the food cooked by someone local was very good.","1) My favorite part in both Nauvoo 2023 and Denver 2024 was just the atmosphere and spirit of the conference. Hundreds of YSA that want to progress and that want to be there and that are friendly and open to meeting new people. Both in Nauvoo in 2023 and Denver 2024, my favorite part was just being around so many YSA that have my standards and values. I didn't realize it until I left, both years, and felt an immediate difference/lessened spirit as I traveled home. It reminds me of the Family Proclamation and For the Strength of Youth - wholesome recreational activity. 2) The YSA broadcast from Sister Yee. She was excellent and it was cool hearing from a spiritual, succesful, single sister.  3) The testimony meeting in groups was great, because we got to meet groups. 4) It was also really cool how much work went into providing a way to the temple - the chartered buses, the temple adding extra sessions.  5) I loved that the conference was local to me, with mostly people who live locally and I can hang out with again, date, etc. ","1) It was a miracle I got to go to the conference at all - when I first found out about the conference is was for 18-30 year olds. I tried to register but was too old. Of course the first conference like this would be when I'm 31 and can't go. But miraculously, the age limit changed to 35, which I am so grateful for.  2) Running into old friends and my group leader from Nauvoo last year 3) A good roommate 4) Meeting new friends.  5) The church putting this conference on and paying so much for it themselves was a miracle. I've been a YSA for 13 years and have waited for something like this so that I can meet people with my standards and are in my area. YSA wards and branches out here are small and it makes it hard to date and have friends. 6) only paying $50 for all of this. I lost my job a month before the conference and $50 was amazing for everything included. ",,,"1) The biggest way these conferences can be improved, both from Nauvoo 2023 and Denver 2024, is MORE GROUP ACTIVITIES. Last year in Nauvoo, so many people were walking around alone because they didn't have a group to do things with, like tour historic sites. Yes we had groups, but they didn't organize anything for our free time. In Denver this year, I would have liked to have more group activities like EFY or like Nauvoo last year. End our day with group reflection. Do group get to know you activities. The only time we got together in groups was for testimony meeting. After testimony meeting, everyone said they wish we would have met our groups sooner. I did like how this year groups were by age, so 31 year olds weren't with 18 year olds. Even though I am local to Denver, I didn't have many friends there. I found myself wandering alone at times, wishing I had a group I could be with. For free time, nightime activities, the activities during our non-temple day, during our dance. Lots of people went there alone wanting to meet people, and they mostly stayed alone because there were no groups. There were also girls and people I wanted to meet, but they were with their group or friends the entire time so it was hard. Assigned groups splits up existing friend groups and forces everyone to meet new people.  2) Better communication beforehand. I realize this was the first conference of it's kind and there was a lot to workout. But we didn't receive much communication until about a week before the conference, which would have made traveling hard if I wasn't local. When I registered it sounded like only people from far away would get to use the dorms. Then later it said everyone could use the dorms. Signing up for the temple was also not communicated well. At one point I was sent an email with a Google Form to sign up for the day and time I was going to the temple, but I didn't even know the conference schedule yet. Then in the end, we got assigned a day.  3) Communication during the conference. The GroupMe was great! However, some things were not clear. Like which classes were which day, where they were located, and how to get to those buildings. After our morningside devotional we were dismissed to go to our classes. Apparently the class options were posted on instagram, but I don't have Instagram. No announcement was made about what the classes were or how to get to them. Also it wasn't clear what day I was supposed to go to the temple. I knew my group number, but not which day that group number was supposed to go.

There needs to be more intimate setting where you can make friends and get to know people. ,negative,negative

I didn't have a chance to get to know him more. ",Poor,"It was like all the beloved teachings of our church in terms of taking care of our bodies were thrown out the window for the duration of the conference. There was an excess of very heavy, very fatty meat, which made me (and lots of other people) sick by the end; and excess of Mac and cheese, and a saddening abscence of simple fruit and salad.  Although I was deeply grateful for the food and for those that helped obtaining and serving it, by the final days I chose to skip the meals. Even then, conference helpers continued to offer food to a pushy extent that made me feel uncomfortable. I remember a day when I was finishing eating, and a volunteer dropped a gigantic breaded chicken breast on my plate from behind me without asking. Although I wasn't particularly offended, I wasn't comfortable with that either. Please, I urge you to consider healthier and more moderate food options for the future. This will not only help us enjoy the conference better, but it'll also keep us healthy, and it'll be inclusive: lots of people were unable to partake of the food due to dietary restrictions. It sucked for me, on given days, to see everyone else eating, and having to sit with the rest empty handed because I couldn't partake of the food. I felt excluded.

",Average,"It wasnât all bad, but some meals didnât have any protein and sometimes it was cold. I ate to sustain myself but it wasnât as good as what I typically eat. A lot of the meals also didnât have much nutrition to them, so I wasnât always feeling as good as when I feed myself with a more balanced meal with vegetables. ","Being in Nauvoo was a huge highlight for me! It was amazing to experience old Nauvoo, see the performing missionaries, and experience the sites. That all meant a ton to me to be able to do the conference there and be with other YSAs who wanted to experience it.   The temple was also a huge highlight, admittedly partly because my temple is currently closed for half the year and the temple is always a highlight.   It was also great to meet other YSAs, connect with old friends, and do it in such a special place.   Several of the workshops I went to were also really good. I appreciated the leadership workshop and the hymn ones especially. ","I saw my MTC companion, who I havenât seen in over 6 years!

Participants are adults, but I think it's important for the church to remind people to wash/sanitize hands before eating and especially before going through buffet lines.

Our church kitchens are not safe for cooking food so I'm not sure how the church deals with that when getting events catered. I wish there were healthier meals planed. Many meals had a fruit/veggie option, but were not very balanced. One day for lunch (pasta) there was no protein. No beans, cheese, meat, eggs, or lentils. I honestly would have been happy with sandwiches with plenty of fruits and veggies as sides or in salads for many meals.
