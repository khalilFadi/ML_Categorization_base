The bathrooms got really really gross at times because of the amount of people using them. Having a plan for cleaning would be good such as having people sign up to help out.  Check in took a long time & we didn’t get our lanyards/name tags until half way through. It was really nice to see peoples names & where they were from so it would be good to have those right at the start.   Sports & activities time in the schedule was not organized well & resulted in a large amount of downtime as there was no adequate space for everyone to play. Some people played sports in the parking lot & that wasn’t a great idea in my opinion due to all the cars. Maybe tell participants to bring a game with them like Uno.   The church building was kind of small. I wonder if another building close by would have been bigger or could have been used for some activities.   There were periods of time in the schedule when there was too much down time. For example, we had way too much time at the Independence Visitors Center. Some of that is hard to predict but I think more opportunities to attend workshops would have been nice & shorter workshops like 30 min instead of 45 min.   The area broadcast was hard to watch, I got very sleepy. I would have rather seen someone in person than watch a broadcast. ', ""I have several recommendations to make the conference better. Some of it has to do with my age (I am 30), some of it has to to with some general observations. They're opinions of course, but I share them with the intent to be helpful.  It seemed that the age of the conference-goers skewed younger. That is not the fault of the conference per se, but I would have loved to have had more opportunities to mingle with young adults more so my age. I talked someone in the stake presidency of Nauvoo (Bro. Seamen) and he told me that they are piloting a program where the YSA conference breaks out into age brackets. I think something like that would be helpful to reach out to the older young single adults who are still in that YSA range. For example, I felt that the dances did not particularly resonate with me. Again, I acknowledge that it seems that most of the conference goers were younger, but I admit that I felt a little out of place at times.  The variety show lasted far too long. I feel bad for those performers who had to compete with the restless crowd and dinner.  Mote get-to-know-you activities  There was a snafu with the buses that I'm sure you are all aware. I took it in stride and made the most of it and acknowledge that some things can't be foreseen, but I encourage more logistical planning if such is needed.  I've never attended fsy, but I have heard that last year's experience definitely had a fsy feel. I'm glad that this conference this year had less of an fsy feel. I suppose it depends on who your target audience is. Once again, as an older ysa, I felt a little out of place. I would love to see some tweaking be done to reach out to older ysas.  Please do not schedule a devotional before a dance. For me, it disrupted the pacing of the devotional. People were trying to get set up for the dance and I found it distracting.  If you've read this so far, I thank you for hearing out my recommendations. I have been very impressed with the efforts of efysa staff and volunteers. The church is moving forward."", ""Overall, it was good however there could have been more classes and activities instead of just Heise.   One they could have gotten a park and done a frisbee golf or ask members of the stake if anyone has spike ball or yard games and just be outside a little more.   Two, A Speed date and actually talk about dating ( I understand it is a hard topic however in the Idaho Falls Area it isn't pushed that much it should be more its a commandment to try in this life to date and be married)   Three, Get to know you games before the Keynote Speaker there was a good amount of time after checking in that could have been used for more things. One I would say a lot of Elders from my quorum would have attended if there were a little bit of video games involved if that Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Jack box games. This would have been great to get to know people a little more.   Four. They should have Done a 5k or 3k we have an amazing greenbelt, that follows the Snake River and goes to the Temple and the weather was perfect in the morning we could have started at the Event Center go to the Temple or church by the temple and then back. Then have a nice savory hearty breakfast made by staff, volunteers (Stake Presidents, other available members of the stake) this would be great to get to know more YSA members overall.   5th.Testimony meeting was great, but I think it should have been saved for the last day or night and switched with the concert and dance to help keep that spirit into the next day to prepare our hearts and mind to service.   6. A little more activity then Heise a lot of people weren't able to do zip lining because a lot of people signed put for zip lining and swimming both days, so some didn't get to enjoy Heise. Got some bowling or Fat Cats Miniature Golf. Rope Course. Just extra things to be doing.   I know there is a lot but being a local here there were so many missed opportunities for things that could have happened with part of this Conference. I did truly enjoy it and needed that with working so much I need to have an added moment of more social interaction. Really that highlight was the dance and I think dances in the YSA should be multi stake or entire area dances to have a good variety of YSA members to meet.  Thank you for your work in putting this all together, May the Grace of God Bless you, -Joseph Kelley   ""]"
