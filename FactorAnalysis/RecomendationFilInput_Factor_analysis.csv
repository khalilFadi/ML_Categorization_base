It would be cool if the devotionals tied into a theme more obviously. And more structured opportunities for spiritual reflection, like hey we're all going to journal/ponder for 30 min about x topic or something.  A shorter variety show.... it was too long (and I say that as someone who was in it!!)  Speed friending was awesome but 30 seconds was too short and it was so loud you had to yell to hear. 3 min would be better. I didn't actually continue talking to almost anyone I met a speed friending.  Not a recommendation but I feel like there was a sense of trying to meet as many new people up to the very end. But by 36 hours in, I was more wanting to make deeper connections with people I already met. But not everyone felt the same way.  Get Connor Price and 100Graham for a concert!  If we're going to be in Nauvoo, I wish the conference had a more obvious tie-in to Nauvoo, that it was mentioned more in the devotionals and such.  Put more things in writing! Make a schedule that's easier to read! I have lots of ideas on logistics. Tell us what the service project is in advance, and also how long the run/walk will be. None of that was publicly announced.  More info about the speakers and activities/opportunities in the opening session. The info was sort of scattered and some quick intros, sort of like an orientation, would be helpful when deciding how to spend time the next few days.  Fewer line dances.  Something to cater to or account for the 25+ split? Happy to meet everyone, but I'm not trying to date someone who just graduated high school. So whether that's a different session, or a different workshop, or something. Idk.   A photo op would be fun too. I really liked the Liahona magazine one at the UTSYA conference.  Clearly I have many thoughts, happy to discuss these topics at length!"", ""I have a few ideas to make the conference better!  1. Don't bring Brandon Sanderson back or Heather Farrell. Brandon Sanderson is someone I really dislike because of many reasons, but his books are very dark and focus too much on evil/antichrists/false prophets, hi talk turned to just be about himself and how he was so awesome for being rich, and several other topics that I didn't feel comfortable. He wasn't the worst, but I would have just checked into the conference, and then left next time. Heather Farrell made her talk really uncomfortable for talking and dwelling on sexual topics and stories from the Bible that took away from the spirit. I also think that since she had just had a baby 3 weeks ago, that she should have been able to be tending to herself and her newborn child. 2. The only talks I heard speak on thinking celestial was brother Chang, sister eubank, and the d'evegnées. Maybe if the other talks were screened more thoroughly, the topic would have been more heavily focused on and the spirit could have been just that much more powerful. 3. I would have loved to have heard from the couple that were the head of the conference. 4. Less driving would have been very nice. If we had had 3 stake centers close by to each other, I would have felt much more safe, or even if I had parked at the MAC and then been shuttled, there would have been less confusion, less danger for the crazy numbers on the road, and our car wouldn't have been backed into so severely (everything was taken care of peacefully and with the spirit present, but it didn't have to happen) 5. It's a small thing, but not having ribs would just be a better thought for our bodies and also financially.  But honestly, all in all, it was a good conference and I really enjoyed the time I spent!"", 'The session director came up to my group asking for feedback and many of us said our favorite part was the freedom of getting to choose who we met, hung out with, and what activities we spent the day doing. He said he heard a lot of similar answers but also some different answers where people reported they felt it was harder to meet people and would have preferred more structured groups and activities to allow them an easier time meeting people. The director asked if we had any ideas on how to solve this disparity, since he valued and wanted to maintain the freedom some found so helpful, and he also wished to help those who felt less comfortable reaching out to people with the lax structure. At the time, I didn’t have any ideas but I do have one now! I think for future conferences, there should be an option during the signup process where people can select if they would prefer to be put into a more structured group that will meet together consistently with others who chose that option; or if they would prefer to be in groups that have more freedom. You could even do a range of options like 1. Mostly structured, 2. Partially structured, and 3. Unstructured. I believe this would allow each individual to pick the most comfortable, helpful, and fun promoting option for THEM and not force anyone into a style of conference they wouldn’t love. The groups can of course interact with each other, and people wouldn’t have to be separated based on their choice, but it would allow for people who prefer to be grouped together to have that option. Based on how many people choose each option during their signup, you can organize people into according groups and make certain structural preparations for those who would rather be in a consistent group to help the meet and bond with others. I think the flexibility and agency of this idea would function really well!  A shorter suggestion involves whoever taught the class on finding your future spouse. To put it bluntly he was a horrible teacher. He took the opportunity of teaching the class to trash talk his wife continuously and do his best to discourage people from getting married. It seemed the intention of his message was “life is hard, marriage is hard and takes a lot of work, but it’s worth it.” EXCEPT he never got to the part about any of his complaints being worth it. He didn’t say one positive thing about his wife or marriage the whole time, didn’t really offer any helpful insight on finding a spouse, and didn’t seem to offer any kind of helpful information to many people I talked to. I don’t wish to only complain but the content of the lesson was shockingly bad and I don’t see how he would have helped anyone. An alternate recommendation for next time would be Brother Goss from Colorado Springs. He taught marriage related lessons at FSY when I was there in 2022. I personally loved his lessons and heard only amazing feedback from anyone else who attended.

EX: replace one of the dances of Trail of Hope or Sunset by the Mississippi. We had to discover these things on our own and had to choose to skip some of the conference activities to do them. At the very least, maybe a better means of communication for all that Nauvoo had to offer? I know they provided us a link for all those things, but it was a lot to navigate if you've never been to Nauvoo. Also, I really enjoyed the freedom to do whatever we wanted while at the conference, but I wonder if having companies would have been helpful. We wouldn't need counselors or rigid schedules, but it would have been a lot easier to make friends if we had a group we could do things with - maybe for some of the bigger events like Carthage or the missionary shows. I went to the conference with a friend, so it didn't feel so isolating, but we really only did things together because everyone kind of already had their own schedules. Had I gone alone, it would have been hard to make connections because there were so many people."", ""Overall, it was good however there could have been more classes and activities instead of just Heise.   One they could have gotten a park and done a frisbee golf or ask members of the stake if anyone has spike ball or yard games and just be outside a little more.   Two, A Speed date and actually talk about dating ( I understand it is a hard topic however in the Idaho Falls Area it isn't pushed that much it should be more its a commandment to try in this life to date and be married)   Three, Get to know you games before the Keynote Speaker there was a good amount of time after checking in that could have been used for more things. One I would say a lot of Elders from my quorum would have attended if there were a little bit of video games involved if that Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Jack box games. This would have been great to get to know people a little more.   Four. They should have Done a 5k or 3k we have an amazing greenbelt, that follows the Snake River and goes to the Temple and the weather was perfect in the morning we could have started at the Event Center go to the Temple or church by the temple and then back. Then have a nice savory hearty breakfast made by staff, volunteers (Stake Presidents, other available members of the stake) this would be great to get to know more YSA members overall.   5th.Testimony meeting was great, but I think it should have been saved for the last day or night and switched with the concert and dance to help keep that spirit into the next day to prepare our hearts and mind to service.   6. A little more activity then Heise a lot of people weren't able to do zip lining because a lot of people signed put for zip lining and swimming both days, so some didn't get to enjoy Heise. Got some bowling or Fat Cats Miniature Golf. Rope Course. Just extra things to be doing.   I know there is a lot but being a local here there were so many missed opportunities for things that could have happened with part of this Conference. I did truly enjoy it and needed that with working so much I need to have an added moment of more social interaction. Really that highlight was the dance and I think dances in the YSA should be multi stake or entire area dances to have a good variety of YSA members to meet.  Thank you for your work in putting this all together, May the Grace of God Bless you, -Joseph Kelley   "", ""1) The biggest way these conferences can be improved, both from Nauvoo 2023 and Denver 2024, is MORE GROUP ACTIVITIES. Last year in Nauvoo, so many people were walking around alone because they didn't have a group to do things with, like tour historic sites. Yes we had groups, but they didn't organize anything for our free time. In Denver this year, I would have liked to have more group activities like EFY or like Nauvoo last year. End our day with group reflection. Do group get to know you activities. The only time we got together in groups was for testimony meeting. After testimony meeting, everyone said they wish we would have met our groups sooner. I did like how this year groups were by age, so 31 year olds weren't with 18 year olds. Even though I am local to Denver, I didn't have many friends there. I found myself wandering alone at times, wishing I had a group I could be with. For free time, nightime activities, the activities during our non-temple day, during our dance. Lots of people went there alone wanting to meet people, and they mostly stayed alone because there were no groups. There were also girls and people I wanted to meet, but they were with their group or friends the entire time so it was hard. Assigned groups splits up existing friend groups and forces everyone to meet new people.  2) Better communication beforehand. I realize this was the first conference of it's kind and there was a lot to workout. But we didn't receive much communication until about a week before the conference, which would have made traveling hard if I wasn't local. When I registered it sounded like only people from far away would get to use the dorms. Then later it said everyone could use the dorms. Signing up for the temple was also not communicated well. At one point I was sent an email with a Google Form to sign up for the day and time I was going to the temple, but I didn't even know the conference schedule yet. Then in the end, we got assigned a day.  3) Communication during the conference. The GroupMe was great! However, some things were not clear. Like which classes were which day, where they were located, and how to get to those buildings. After our morningside devotional we were dismissed to go to our classes. Apparently the class options were posted on instagram, but I don't have Instagram. No announcement was made about what the classes were or how to get to them. Also it wasn't clear what day I was supposed to go to the temple. I knew my group number, but not which day that group number was supposed to go. ""]"

6,6,30,6_age_are_adults_that,"['age', 'are', 'adults', 'that', 'to', 'young', 'ysa', 'of', 'the', 'and']","[""One thing that I would recommend is maybe splitting the age groups up just a little bit so that you can know who is actually your age! One way this could be accomplished is during testimony meeting you could spilt it up like okay 18-20 year olds whose last name starts with A-H go to this room and so on and so forth.  I honestly think that just splitting up age groups for all of is would be awesome because guys would come up and talk to me and ask me for my number and I'd ask for their age and they'd be in their 30's where I am only 18."", ""I've already mentioned. You need more older experienced fun young singles that know how to make a good dance. That know fun activities that locally might know more people that can attend. Helping kids with activities where they can socialize as much as the spiritual part. I really don't think anyone will truly read my survey. I've been a single for a long time. I know what works and what doesn't for these activities. There need to be better social setting where singles can talk or learn to meet new people. To be open to dating people with good standards. It's not forced its just when you have good activities a long with spiritual than it helps the singles more. As a man I honestly think the world tries to divide young singles. Women don't respect guys as much. What it means to be a future father to provide protect. Many people are selfish in there indevers to meet people. Society tell women you don't need men. We need to be taught the importance in these confrnce for one another and God's plan of happiness. We use apps to swipe instead of getting to know people. Need to put forth a better environment that's fun that forces young singles to talk and recognize the value of a good man and women in the church. There are lots of ideas. If you ignore the struggles or pretend like there not there. Nothing gets better. We can't come closer to christ if don't try to recognize struggles, teach the right way and than let us benefit from the different activities. "", ""I have several recommendations to make the conference better. Some of it has to do with my age (I am 30), some of it has to to with some general observations. They're opinions of course, but I share them with the intent to be helpful.  It seemed that the age of the conference-goers skewed younger. That is not the fault of the conference per se, but I would have loved to have had more opportunities to mingle with young adults more so my age. I talked someone in the stake presidency of Nauvoo (Bro. Seamen) and he told me that they are piloting a program where the YSA conference breaks out into age brackets. I think something like that would be helpful to reach out to the older young single adults who are still in that YSA range. For example, I felt that the dances did not particularly resonate with me. Again, I acknowledge that it seems that most of the conference goers were younger, but I admit that I felt a little out of place at times.  The variety show lasted far too long. I feel bad for those performers who had to compete with the restless crowd and dinner.  Mote get-to-know-you activities  There was a snafu with the buses that I'm sure you are all aware. I took it in stride and made the most of it and acknowledge that some things can't be foreseen, but I encourage more logistical planning if such is needed.  I've never attended fsy, but I have heard that last year's experience definitely had a fsy feel. I'm glad that this conference this year had less of an fsy feel. I suppose it depends on who your target audience is. Once again, as an older ysa, I felt a little out of place. I would love to see some tweaking be done to reach out to older ysas.  Please do not schedule a devotional before a dance. For me, it disrupted the pacing of the devotional. People were trying to get set up for the dance and I found it distracting.  If you've read this so far, I thank you for hearing out my recommendations. I have been very impressed with the efforts of efysa staff and volunteers. The church is moving forward.""]"

There were multiple times where we were just sitting for an hour or more in between activities. For example, on the schedule it said sports and games from 3-5 but there were none so we just sat around for 2 hours at the stake building.   I also thought it was weird that we had three hours at the visitors center and 25 minutes at the Joesph Smith History building. The visitors center tour took 45 min and we spent the remaining hours sitting outside. ', 'It needs better organization. You did not tell anyone what the service project entailed so you had people showing up in shorts to walk through tick infested forests.   It would be better is everyone had housing. Going back and forth was difficult. The stake center was too small - it was hard to socialize if your free time. It was also hard to do the activities like the dance or sports time.  Include more fun things - I like being spiritual but people also was to connect with others while doing something fun.  Structured activities are a must - driving an hour on a bus only to be dropped off in the middle of nowhere with no direction or guide was useless.  Have separate activities for the 25 and up crowd - I didn’t meet a single new person in the age group. ', 'The planning for this entire conference was very poorly done. From the way check-in was handled to the service projects to the talent show… Just about all of it was very confusing and frustrating. No one knew what was going on, or I would get conflicting answers. Things were scheduled back-to-back with no room for inconveniences, so when one thing was delayed, the whole day was delayed. As someone with a disability, I also felt the accommodations were lacking. I asked for a first floor room; I was given a fourth floor room. The service project was not explained in advance, so I had no idea that I wouldn’t be able to do the main service project of planting trees. I couldn’t even board the bus because the waiver required that I have good health, which I don’t have. Then, I wasn’t told about the backup service project until after everyone had left, and it appeared only one person really knew what the backup project was. As someone who went to the EFYSA prototype in Nauvoo, I am very disappointed with how poorly done this conference was, especially considering the Nauvoo one went so much smoother.']"

We were encouraged to carpool, but I, as well as many others, signed up for the conference alone. I was the only one from my ward that went. This made it difficult to find rides, especially for the first day. I have two possible solutions for this. One would be to have participants sign up to be a carpool driver during the registration process, these volunteers could be identified via a different colored lanyard so that participants without rides can locate/approach them easily. I have no problem asking for rides, but it was difficult finding someone who actually had space, I usually ended up asking at least five people before I found a ride. A second possibility would be to have participants join specific group me chats for the destinations/events that they plan attend at the beginning of the conference so that they can plan out their rides for the week in advance with people going to the same place as them.   2. The conference was great, but something that I noticed was that our schedules were packed from 9:00AM to at least 9:00PM each day. By day two, people were tired, especially because almost everyone had a 30 min+ drive to and from the Mountain America Center. My suggestion is that the activities end earlier so that people can leave without feeling like they're missing out and the YSA that still have energy can have opportunities to do unplanned activities with those they have met at the conference.  3. There were a lot of people, myself included, that were not as outgoing. I would love to see more activities that allow the participants to meet new friends. Possible ideas are get to know you games(which were played for 30 minutes of the first night), speed dating, team games/competitions, or anything where we need to work together. The service project was a great example of being in a group working together and getting to know each other.""]"
