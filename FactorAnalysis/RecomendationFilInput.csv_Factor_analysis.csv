1,1,101,1_activities_the_to_more,"['activities', 'the', 'to', 'more', 'and', 'was', 'of', 'have', 'would', 'time']","['The planning for this entire conference was very poorly done. From the way check-in was handled to the service projects to the talent show… Just about all of it was very confusing and frustrating. No one knew what was going on, or I would get conflicting answers. Things were scheduled back-to-back with no room for inconveniences, so when one thing was delayed, the whole day was delayed. As someone with a disability, I also felt the accommodations were lacking. I asked for a first floor room; I was given a fourth floor room. The service project was not explained in advance, so I had no idea that I wouldn’t be able to do the main service project of planting trees. I couldn’t even board the bus because the waiver required that I have good health, which I don’t have. Then, I wasn’t told about the backup service project until after everyone had left, and it appeared only one person really knew what the backup project was. As someone who went to the EFYSA prototype in Nauvoo, I am very disappointed with how poorly done this conference was, especially considering the Nauvoo one went so much smoother.', 'It needs better organization. You did not tell anyone what the service project entailed so you had people showing up in shorts to walk through tick infested forests.   It would be better is everyone had housing. Going back and forth was difficult. The stake center was too small - it was hard to socialize if your free time. It was also hard to do the activities like the dance or sports time.  Include more fun things - I like being spiritual but people also was to connect with others while doing something fun.  Structured activities are a must - driving an hour on a bus only to be dropped off in the middle of nowhere with no direction or guide was useless.  Have separate activities for the 25 and up crowd - I didn’t meet a single new person in the age group. ', 'I felt like the ysa committee members did an amazing job but it didn’t seem to me like there were a lot of them & they were asked to do A LOT it seemed to me so maybe more helpers would have been beneficial.   The bathrooms got really really gross at times because of the amount of people using them. Having a plan for cleaning would be good such as having people sign up to help out.  Check in took a long time & we didn’t get our lanyards/name tags until half way through. It was really nice to see peoples names & where they were from so it would be good to have those right at the start.   Sports & activities time in the schedule was not organized well & resulted in a large amount of downtime as there was no adequate space for everyone to play. Some people played sports in the parking lot & that wasn’t a great idea in my opinion due to all the cars. Maybe tell participants to bring a game with them like Uno.   The church building was kind of small. I wonder if another building close by would have been bigger or could have been used for some activities.   There were periods of time in the schedule when there was too much down time. For example, we had way too much time at the Independence Visitors Center. Some of that is hard to predict but I think more opportunities to attend workshops would have been nice & shorter workshops like 30 min instead of 45 min.   The area broadcast was hard to watch, I got very sleepy. I would have rather seen someone in person than watch a broadcast. ']"
2,2,80,2_the_to_and_of,"['the', 'to', 'and', 'of', 'conference', 'have', 'that', 'would', 'for', 'was']","[""For the theme being Think Celestial, I would have like the speakers for the break out rooms to talk more about Christ. Most talked about the Gospel and brought in scriptures and examples... But the ones I attended didn't ever testify of Christ or have Him be the center of the discussion. It was about the sacrament table but not Christ's a toning sacrifice. It was about changing your thinking habits and the science behind it but not about leaning on the Savior for help through it (that one they mentioned more about the fact that they were working on publishing their findings than about Christ). I really needed to learn of my Savior in a way that aimed only for YSA. It was the one time to have only one demographic in an area to speak of Christ, rejoice of Christ, and it felt like every speaker took away from Christ and focused on the imperfections of how we are worshiping and how they think we can change it, again without Christ. Not that they avoided the topic for they used scriptures and all ended in His name but that was it. I left feeling further from my Savior then when I started. I had gone to the Boise one and it had been a great experience where each lecture had been about the Savior and His example or testimony or teaching and so I was so excited to come to this one. But I really felt like the mark got missed. "", ""I have a few ideas to make the conference better!  1. Don't bring Brandon Sanderson back or Heather Farrell. Brandon Sanderson is someone I really dislike because of many reasons, but his books are very dark and focus too much on evil/antichrists/false prophets, hi talk turned to just be about himself and how he was so awesome for being rich, and several other topics that I didn't feel comfortable. He wasn't the worst, but I would have just checked into the conference, and then left next time. Heather Farrell made her talk really uncomfortable for talking and dwelling on sexual topics and stories from the Bible that took away from the spirit. I also think that since she had just had a baby 3 weeks ago, that she should have been able to be tending to herself and her newborn child. 2. The only talks I heard speak on thinking celestial was brother Chang, sister eubank, and the d'evegnées. Maybe if the other talks were screened more thoroughly, the topic would have been more heavily focused on and the spirit could have been just that much more powerful. 3. I would have loved to have heard from the couple that were the head of the conference. 4. Less driving would have been very nice. If we had had 3 stake centers close by to each other, I would have felt much more safe, or even if I had parked at the MAC and then been shuttled, there would have been less confusion, less danger for the crazy numbers on the road, and our car wouldn't have been backed into so severely (everything was taken care of peacefully and with the spirit present, but it didn't have to happen) 5. It's a small thing, but not having ribs would just be a better thought for our bodies and also financially.  But honestly, all in all, it was a good conference and I really enjoyed the time I spent!"", 'The session director came up to my group asking for feedback and many of us said our favorite part was the freedom of getting to choose who we met, hung out with, and what activities we spent the day doing. He said he heard a lot of similar answers but also some different answers where people reported they felt it was harder to meet people and would have preferred more structured groups and activities to allow them an easier time meeting people. The director asked if we had any ideas on how to solve this disparity, since he valued and wanted to maintain the freedom some found so helpful, and he also wished to help those who felt less comfortable reaching out to people with the lax structure. At the time, I didn’t have any ideas but I do have one now! I think for future conferences, there should be an option during the signup process where people can select if they would prefer to be put into a more structured group that will meet together consistently with others who chose that option; or if they would prefer to be in groups that have more freedom. You could even do a range of options like 1. Mostly structured, 2. Partially structured, and 3. Unstructured. I believe this would allow each individual to pick the most comfortable, helpful, and fun promoting option for THEM and not force anyone into a style of conference they wouldn’t love. The groups can of course interact with each other, and people wouldn’t have to be separated based on their choice, but it would allow for people who prefer to be grouped together to have that option. Based on how many people choose each option during their signup, you can organize people into according groups and make certain structural preparations for those who would rather be in a consistent group to help the meet and bond with others. I think the flexibility and agency of this idea would function really well!  A shorter suggestion involves whoever taught the class on finding your future spouse. To put it bluntly he was a horrible teacher. He took the opportunity of teaching the class to trash talk his wife continuously and do his best to discourage people from getting married. It seemed the intention of his message was “life is hard, marriage is hard and takes a lot of work, but it’s worth it.” EXCEPT he never got to the part about any of his complaints being worth it. He didn’t say one positive thing about his wife or marriage the whole time, didn’t really offer any helpful insight on finding a spouse, and didn’t seem to offer any kind of helpful information to many people I talked to. I don’t wish to only complain but the content of the lesson was shockingly bad and I don’t see how he would have helped anyone. An alternate recommendation for next time would be Brother Goss from Colorado Springs. He taught marriage related lessons at FSY when I was there in 2022. I personally loved his lessons and heard only amazing feedback from anyone else who attended.

Both are AMAZING, but knowing the difference beforehand is helpful. I think we all thought we would have a lot more opportunities & time to meet more people outside of the group we traveled around with.   -activity options closer to the main building would be nice, limiting travel time all day ', ""I feel like we spent a lot of time in the car traveling. Heise was a really fun idea and lots of fun activities, but I don't know if it was worth the drive there and back. I feel like a lot of people went to the conference to meet people and make new friends and that was hard because we spent time in the car, not mingling between activities. Also, we were late to all the classes because the traffic of everyone switching church buildings was so bad. I would recommend having all the classes at the event center in different rooms, or having the teachers switch buildings so we have time to talk to other ysa's between the classes!"", ""The travel from place to place was terrible. I didn't know anybody until I got there. I had to make plans to use a car to get from Rexburg to Idaho Falls(IF) Every day. when I did make it to IF I traveled a lot from place to place. there was not enough time to get to know people because of the travel time. I REALLY WATED TO ENJOY IT BUT THE ONE THOUGHGT WAS WHY IF? Rexburg would of been better. there is a college and you could of use the school. Also there church you can walk to. Even if you didnt use the school the travel from class to class would of been better where you can walk everywhere. there is more classes, buildings, and places to go. IF was the worst place to have the conference. It come me gas, time and more money to get to the conference then what I thought it was worth. even if it was in Pocatello i would of still came but the travel from place to place would of been better do the the closeness of the places the churches and the rooms ""]"

Too many slow dance songs, and not enough guys asking girls to dance. Perhaps doing a theme dance that stimulates asking people to dance?

The music stopped at the dance a couple times, downloading could help. It would be great to hear something like “two songs left” or “last slow dance” so the ending doesn’t come so abruptly: :) Also, many songs were in between and it was hard to tell if they were a group dance or slow dance. More time between to compensate for classes? Or closer locations. We were asked our T-shirt size in the sign-up, but we didn’t receive T-shirts.

7,7,25,7_nauvoo_the_to_we,"['nauvoo', 'the', 'to', 'we', 'of', 'in', 'for', 'classes', 'were', 'but']","[""I think a lot of people didn't know about the other things to do in Nauvoo and missed out (specially mentioning old nauvoo). I also think that other than the speed friendshipping attempt, there weren't many purposeful activities towards meeting people which was hard for some. Also if the conference for Nauvoo was specifically for people of that area, please add that... we went from Utah and very much felt almost unwelcomed. I honestly really struggled with that a lot. I hated that aspect. I felt like I didn't belong. I noticed that the efysa for other places specifically said for ysa of specific areas but Nauvoo didn't have that request. I was really excited to see the church sites that I probably never would have. "", ""Better expectations of what the conference will entail. Signing up for classes was great to be able to pick we classes we wanted. However, I know nauvoo pretty well, but many of the YSA had never been before. So in their free time they didn't know how to plan to see the historic sights. For me it was easy to know where to go or what to do. But many missed out on experiences they could have had at nauvoo. Having a visitors guides or suggested places to visit to make sure they can know what to do. "", ""I really wish the conference would have included more Nauvoo-specific activities. EX: replace one of the dances of Trail of Hope or Sunset by the Mississippi. We had to discover these things on our own and had to choose to skip some of the conference activities to do them. At the very least, maybe a better means of communication for all that Nauvoo had to offer? I know they provided us a link for all those things, but it was a lot to navigate if you've never been to Nauvoo. Also, I really enjoyed the freedom to do whatever we wanted while at the conference, but I wonder if having companies would have been helpful. We wouldn't need counselors or rigid schedules, but it would have been a lot easier to make friends if we had a group we could do things with - maybe for some of the bigger events like Carthage or the missionary shows. I went to the conference with a friend, so it didn't feel so isolating, but we really only did things together because everyone kind of already had their own schedules. Had I gone alone, it would have been hard to make connections because there were so many people.""]"

9,9,18,9_age_are_that_adults,"['age', 'are', 'that', 'adults', 'young', 'to', 'the', 'of', 'with', 'singles']","[""One thing that I would recommend is maybe splitting the age groups up just a little bit so that you can know who is actually your age! One way this could be accomplished is during testimony meeting you could spilt it up like okay 18-20 year olds whose last name starts with A-H go to this room and so on and so forth.  I honestly think that just splitting up age groups for all of is would be awesome because guys would come up and talk to me and ask me for my number and I'd ask for their age and they'd be in their 30's where I am only 18."", ""I've already mentioned. You need more older experienced fun young singles that know how to make a good dance. That know fun activities that locally might know more people that can attend. Helping kids with activities where they can socialize as much as the spiritual part. I really don't think anyone will truly read my survey. I've been a single for a long time. I know what works and what doesn't for these activities. There need to be better social setting where singles can talk or learn to meet new people. To be open to dating people with good standards. It's not forced its just when you have good activities a long with spiritual than it helps the singles more. As a man I honestly think the world tries to divide young singles. Women don't respect guys as much. What it means to be a future father to provide protect. Many people are selfish in there indevers to meet people. Society tell women you don't need men. We need to be taught the importance in these confrnce for one another and God's plan of happiness. We use apps to swipe instead of getting to know people. Need to put forth a better environment that's fun that forces young singles to talk and recognize the value of a good man and women in the church. There are lots of ideas. If you ignore the struggles or pretend like there not there. Nothing gets better. We can't come closer to christ if don't try to recognize struggles, teach the right way and than let us benefit from the different activities. "", ""I have several recommendations to make the conference better. Some of it has to do with my age (I am 30), some of it has to to with some general observations. They're opinions of course, but I share them with the intent to be helpful.  It seemed that the age of the conference-goers skewed younger. That is not the fault of the conference per se, but I would have loved to have had more opportunities to mingle with young adults more so my age. I talked someone in the stake presidency of Nauvoo (Bro. Seamen) and he told me that they are piloting a program where the YSA conference breaks out into age brackets. I think something like that would be helpful to reach out to the older young single adults who are still in that YSA range. For example, I felt that the dances did not particularly resonate with me. Again, I acknowledge that it seems that most of the conference goers were younger, but I admit that I felt a little out of place at times.  The variety show lasted far too long. I feel bad for those performers who had to compete with the restless crowd and dinner.  Mote get-to-know-you activities  There was a snafu with the buses that I'm sure you are all aware. I took it in stride and made the most of it and acknowledge that some things can't be foreseen, but I encourage more logistical planning if such is needed.  I've never attended fsy, but I have heard that last year's experience definitely had a fsy feel. I'm glad that this conference this year had less of an fsy feel. I suppose it depends on who your target audience is. Once again, as an older ysa, I felt a little out of place. I would love to see some tweaking be done to reach out to older ysas.  Please do not schedule a devotional before a dance. For me, it disrupted the pacing of the devotional. People were trying to get set up for the dance and I found it distracting.  If you've read this so far, I thank you for hearing out my recommendations. I have been very impressed with the efforts of efysa staff and volunteers. The church is moving forward.""]"
