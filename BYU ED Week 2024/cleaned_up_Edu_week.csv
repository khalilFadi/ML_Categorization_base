Reawakened in my a desire for all things holy and the power of being around so many good like minded people with such light and love.  Helped me feel like I can better face the challenges my life includes and this particularly difficult upcoming year will be. I had felt so overwhelmed, stressed and lacking in hope. But left Ed week with tools, motivation and faith to handle it. The opportunities for increased knowledge and learning about the scriptures, the Saviour, relationships and psychology were particularly impactful and appreciated. Being from Eastern Canada were members are few, the chance to see an apostle was a thrill. Thanks Ed week for an absolutely amazing experience ",5

It could just be one craft or project per day with a class limit, obviously, taught at every available hour from 8 AM to 9 PM to allow as many people as possible to participate each day.

I would totally have early registered if it had risen to the top of my to-do list with a booklet sitting on the counter reminding me.

I felt like the classes we attended did a great job of looking at the deeper meaning of scriptures--especially exploring the Old Testament-- and their application in our lives. Education Week is just a time to go and enjoy learning with the only test being the interpretation of my own notes later.

It also occurred to me how fun it would be to have some kind of craft or sewing class that was hands-on for an extra fee. It would have to be early registration, but it would be so fun to learn a new skill and practice it. It could just be one craft or project per day with a class limit, obviously, taught at every available hour from 8 AM to 9 PM to allow as many people as possible to participate each day.  ALSO: On registration day, get at least 40 employees at tables processing registrations so that the line doesn't stretch half way around the Marriott Center. We actually gave up on the first class and came back later. This could have been avoided with triple the number of people processing registrations.  Oh...and PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE send me a copy of the Education Week booklet of classes in the mail in mid-July. We did not get ANY kind of notification, and there was no easy download of the PDF (no button to click); you had to watch the video to find a link. It's so much easier to have a PDF where I can print the pages I want to remember. I would totally have early registered if it had risen to the top of my to-do list with a booklet sitting on the counter reminding me.

However, I was shocked at some of the false doctrine being pushed in Avram Shannon's classes and Jan Martin's class (e.g., men's priesthood offices are essentially irrelevant since women have full priesthood power, single people will be exalted, WE establish Zion when we give all our stuff to poor people, Lehi's family was enslaved by other groups while traveling in the Arabian peninsula).   The other disappointment was all the religion classes that appealed to emotion and that indulged feelings of victimhood or entitlement instead of looking at sound, doctrinally based answers (that is the best way that I can describe it). I sat through a class about how the temple helps me become like Jesus Christ, but the last thing presented was a poem from a former atheist who tried to smash the phone and get rid of it but finally answered it, and God was on the other side saying, ""I love you"" or something like that. Like, this was utter appeal to pathos was fairly sickening given all that President Nelson and Church leaders have said about our need to be in the temple and receiving revelation there.

For example, the class ""Coming Closer to Jesus Christ through The Chosen"" was wildly popular and really should have been held in the Marriott Center. Additionally, the class ""Finding Faith in Temple Worship"" was also quite popular, and I ended up in the overflow almost every time. I wouldn't mind the overflow if it wasn't for all the issues that came with broadcasting the class via Zoom. Transitions between the slide deck and the classroom camera always lagged by several minutes, and the audio from the instructor's computer was not connected, and so those in the overflow couldn't hear the video/audio clips that were being played. Attendance in an overflow classroom was therefore quite inferior to attending in the actual auditorium.  The vast majority of the Education Week instructors were excellent. There were a couple instructors, however, that I found dissatisfying. The first was John L.

People were told not to save seats but most people attend with friends or family and want to enjoy some classes together.  Then they can share in the spirit there and talk about the message later. I don’t know the perfect answer to the seat saving problem except to accommodate more people.   Also, there are some teachers who were hard to understand due to age or illness and it’s probably time to pass the baton, as sad as it may be. ","I learned so many great things!

I know you never know but even changing mid week would have been a preferable option than multiple overflows.   I felt sorry for the hosts who had to send people away to the overflow. They would say the room was full but there would still be empty seats available and they was a frustration for attendees. They just didn’t have the complete information.   People were told not to save seats but most people attend with friends or family and want to enjoy some classes together.  Then they can share in the spirit there and talk about the message later. I don’t know the perfect answer to the seat saving problem except to accommodate more people.   Also, there are some teachers who were hard to understand due to age or illness and it’s probably time to pass the baton, as sad as it may be. ",5

The attendance numbers in each classroom are often skewed because after the first day, people figure out that they need to attend the class before the actual presenter they want to hear from. An example of this is Andrew Skinner- I loved him as my professor 40 years ago, but time has taken its toll. He earned the WSC ballroom this year and I am guessing it is because of his attendance numbers from last year. You may not realize-most attended his class last year in order to get a seat for Elder Callister who presented after him.

The attendance numbers in each classroom are often skewed because after the first day, people figure out that they need to attend the class before the actual presenter they want to hear from. An example of this is Andrew Skinner- I loved him as my professor 40 years ago, but time has taken its toll. He earned the WSC ballroom this year and I am guessing it is because of his attendance numbers from last year. You may not realize-most attended his class last year in order to get a seat for Elder Callister who presented after him.

I did ""attend"" the 2020 online Education Week when on campus was canceled due to COVID.  When my kids were young my husband would take the week off from work and be with the kids so I could attend. As they turned 14 I would bring them with me so they could attend. After they grew and left on missions, college and marriage, my husband attended with me.  For me Education week helped me with parenting skills when kids were young,  and later in helping me stay the course in scripture and general conference study.  Now that I am older, I still enjoy coming and learning more about the Savior and our Church history, and other topics offered during the week. My husband's and my second mission was the Missouri Independence Mission where we were Historical Site Missionaries at Liberty Jail so I enjoy the Church History classes.  My husband passed a few years ago and classes on grieving were also helpful.  I now attend with friends. I love the things I learn and work to incorporate what I learn into my life.

If presenters could do their class a couple of times, that would be great! •  Specify on the class schedule whether a class is ""self-standing"" or ""series.""

What about a few more locations where you're allowed to eat while listening?  Or have class overflow options in food-okay locations? •  Loved that there were more ""grab and go"" food options!  And the lines moved pretty quickly, with a nice variety of menu choices.  I think even more of these would be great! •  Walking all the way through Heritage to get up to the Harmon and Conference buildings was a challenge.  Are there any other large size meeting spaces closer to the rest of campus that could be used instead?  We made the trek up there for a couple of classes, but would have participated in more of those classes if they just hadn't been so far away.  It was a deterrent for those presenters. •  Clearly ""The Chosen"" presentation was way more popular than expected.  With like 6 overflow rooms?  That one should have been in the Marriott Center.  Can he please come do that again?  We missed out when the room was always full. • Can popular classes be offered more than once during the day?  It's rough when you only get one chance to see someone and it conflicts with something else or is too far away.  If presenters could do their class a couple of times, that would be great! •  Specify on the class schedule whether a class is ""self-standing"" or ""series.""  We did more bouncing around, and felt lost in a couple of classes when the presenter would assume you'd been there the previous day.  We would generally like more ""self-standing"" classes so you don't feel like you have to be in that same class every day, but can enjoy a wider variety of topics and presenters. •  The BYU employees and volunteer staff members were completely wonderful!  Kind and efficient - just awesome!",4

One teacher I want to make sure to shout out is Brian Andre. I attended his class on ministering on Friday and it was masterfully done. I felt so inspired to be a better minister and disciple, and yet, I don’t think he ever said the word minister?? He just taught me about my Savior and how to be more like Him. He shared of my Savior’s love for me in a way that I didn’t realize I needed to be reminded but I’m beyond grateful. I’ve felt so close to Jesus since his class.

","I was blessed to be accepted as a student in 1988 to BYU as one of 2 ""Mormons"" in my entire high school in Indiana. But this was my first time to ever attend Education Week. I don't know if I quite have the words to describe this experience, but I'll try.  I was taken back 35 years in time as this experience was the SWEET SALVE to my LONGING SOUL and a special HEALING for my BROKEN HEART. My husband and I met at BYU in 1988. After serving missions, we ran into each other again in 1993 at a dance in the Wilk, and the rest is history. We thought we were ""following the recipe"" as returned missionaries, learned in the Gospel, children of adult convert parents, married in the temple, served in the church faithfully, taught our children the Gospel.. and even had a child go on to serve a mission. But over time, it became obvious that we were just going through the motions of discipleship. And then in 2019, my husband became an enemy to the church and my children each followed. I've been navigating life along the iron rod by myself again, like back home in Indiana. Again, I find myself standing as a witness at all times and in all places, even as I stand alone. While staying at the dorms last week, the Lord poured out His tender blessings to me in the form of REMEMBERANCES of my years as a student there, walking this same paths, entering those same buildings, feeling that same power of God that permeates those hallways almost like a penetrating wind from the mountains. Memories of personal manifestations of the Spirit resurfaced from the depths of my senses, carrying with them sweet spiritual healing as well as personal revelation. Familiar images and memories were brought to my mind, heart and soul through His Holy Spirit as I sat in the very same seats in classes where I was nourished by the good word of God with TRUTH during a pivotal point in adulthood... and there I sat at another pivotal point in my life as a disciple of Christ. Rememberances of the sweet savor of His fruits and precious truths literally awakened and enlivened the fibers of my being after having been dormant for years. Impressions were confirmed; truths were witnessed; testimony was strengthened; my broken heart was mended to almost new again; and my spirit humbled to an openness I've missed.  Thank you for continuing to offer this wonderful feast for us old folks! It is my life's desire to now go forth to serve... Also, I would LOVE to present at Education Week someday!

","Tana Page's class motivated me to start a writing group, which I had never thought of or knew there was such a thing. I made an announcement at church on Sunday and had fliers to hand out and contacted the person who is in charge of the weekly newsletter. We will meet twice a month and our first meeting is September 3rd.  On Friday, the 23rd, I texted my immediate family, my 1st cousins and as many of my mom's first cousins, that I had contacts for, and asked them to spread the word that I need their help with stories about their families and our ancestors (all non-members) because I am compiling stories for a family history book. I asked for pictures, copies of letters, stories of heirlooms, etc. and got quite a few positive responses!   Kelly Summer's class was amazing. I went to the grocery store and spent most of my time in the produce aisle. I just needed to be reminded that God created our bodies and He has created all the plants and herbs to keep it healthy and strong. And that a lot of things that are so-called ""food"" that are man-made are for profit and business, not necessarily for our bodies. She should have her own show on T.V. The Word of Wisdom is for every body. I am being more careful from now on.    I really enjoyed all my classes. I wish I could go to all of them. It would be a great idea if you don't already to repeat classes several times so that eventually I can go to all of them. I'm so exhausted by Friday, because I start Monday and all week I go 8:30-8:00. I do my best to be a good person, I knew which classes would invite the spirit, Goodman & Gibson, so I always try to go to ones that I know will fill me with light. Curtis was intellectual and knowledgable and I learned so much. He is a phenomenal teacher as well as entertaining. I went to Diana Elder's class, Alice Child's class, and went one time to the BYU research lab class once (but I wanted to attend another class, and the other class won out)  I want to be better at Genealogy. I loved the Gospel App class and use it so much more, because now I know what is on it. I downloaded all the church apps and today I used the coloring book on the kids app with my 18 month old granddaughter. I didn't know how to highlight and take notes and tag before. Now I do! I taught R.S. on Sunday and got to use notes as part of the lesson. So cool!!!",2–5,"My husband and I moved from California to Utah in September of 2020.

I don't know if they select their own topics or if someone asks them to present a specific topic, but it would be good to see a bit more variety in the subjects presented -- especially for those presenters who come annually and repeat much of what they have presented in prior years.  ",6–10,We love it and we appreciate hearing new and inspiring topics. We especially appreciate the classes taught by very competent and knowledgeable instructors but who are still humble. ,Strongly Influenced,Strongly Influenced,Somewhat Influenced,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Male,74,Utah,,,"Not much could improve it. However, it was sometimes a bit difficult to find the potential classes and presenters that I wanted. They are listed in two sections: 1) in the front by time and location 2) later by presenter for each class period. However, one had to search through each hour and session to find the class desired. They seemed to be listed in random order within that block of time. Could they not be listed in alphabetical order according to the presenter's last name so that it would be easy to find them in that section?  Thanks. ",5

It would have been comforting if we could have spoken to an Education Werk employee. It was at 4:30 pm on Saturday when I tried to reach your staff. Every phone number listed was set for Monday through Friday use. My suggestion is to provide an after hours phone number on your Education Week paperwork l for those who set up arrival times on the weekend. It would have helped us.    At 8:50 pm on a week night, the path to our assigned dorm was being pelted with water from the sprinklers. Since many people might be returning from dinner or some other excursion, it is my suggestion that you adjust the timing. Many of us are elderly, possibly handicapped. That slipperiness is an accident waiting to happen.  I hope these suggestions are helpful; namely,  1. Assign keys as noted on the Education Week Receipt and Name Badge paperwork;  2. Provide after hours phone contact information for your Education Week attendees on the Education Week Receipt and Name Badge paperwork; 3. Suspend watering your lawns adjacent to the Education Week dormitories' walkways during times that your elderly or disabled attendees might likely be using the walkways  Thank you for your consideration.

I left the first class feeling terrible, like I had no power to make decisions and that my life was actually being micro-managed based on the covenants I decide to make. Let me say that I have a very strong testimony, so it didn't shake me at all doctrinally, but his content did make me feel like I was a cog in a wheel, rather than being able to steer that wheel. Also, he is old fashioned and very dated in his approach to homosexuality and shared his opinions on those matters openly with ""side comments"" throughout his lecture. To be honest, I don't think he even knew he was being offensive with what he was saying, which kind of made it worse. In addition, there was someone who made a comment in his class and in response, he was rude and condescending to that person. I felt embarrassed for not only him, but the person who made the comment as well. I attended his first class because the content interested me, but I did not return after that. It was a very uncomfortable class.  Kimberly Parry--The title of her class interested me, but it was an absolute complete waste of my time. She spent the first 20 minutes of the class trying to drill in the punch line from a joke she had made. She was self deprecating and used humor as a way to bouy herself  up through people's laughter, rather than using it as a tool to help her presentation hit home.  It felt like she was trying to be a stand up comedian. She was name dropping and inflating her ego every few minutes or so. There was NO content to her slides or material. I was so disappointed because not only did I really want to know more about what her class series described and there was nothing to take away from it, but I also wasted the hour not being able to go to another class of interest. It was obvious that she was very self-conscious, had imposter syndrome, and felt the need to prove to everyone in her class why she was qualified to be up there teaching. Sadly, in an effort to prove her qualifications, she did more than disprove them, she killed them. I know this is a harsh review, but really, the class was terrible. I didn't return to any of her lectures again.  I like the idea of having a TEDtalk series....where instructors have 15 minutes to make their points and hone their presentations to be concise, informationally potent, and really enjoyable to listen to. This could possibly be in the Marriot Center, so people who can't move well or get to classes easily could be able to sit there and enjoy the presentations. It would also benefit those who are coming for really concentrated presentations where the information is easily presented and easily ingested by the listener. It would also help the presenters as well with being more focused in their material and creating a more streamlined approach to what they are hoping to get out to their audience.

I am a first generation convert, a single mother raising 3 daughters in the gospel, living in California.   I attended BYU for my masters, but life has taken unexpected twists since I lived in Utah, mostly that of a divorce from someone who also left the gospel. This singular event (divorce not of my choosing) sent my testimony in a downward tailspin. Not even the Savior, it seemed, could stop this pain from happening (to me, yes, but moreso to my children).  This week was a much-needed boost to focus on my spiritual connection to the Savior, the Spirit, and to the church (the lens of the church as an administrative organization of humans).   I quite literally walk away feeling cloaked in the full armor of God. My activity level prior to this week “looked” like my heart was it it, but truly I had many doubts that were *very* strong. It was very painful at times to think about choosing a path of life where the gospel and church may not have been a part of my future.   I am not exaggerating when I say this event has brought me peace and put my heart mostly at rest, inasmuch as doubts and concerns go.   For context, I enjoy attending all 12 hours, and my best friend from college often attends with me.   Additionally, the finance/estate/investing classes are very valuable and I attend as many as I can. That is an area I feel strong in already, and these add to my current body of knowledge to keep me up to speed.  BYU Ed week has always been enjoyable and uplifting, and this year was the best.   And by the way- of the biggest testimonies I have (and have always held) is that “by their fruits ye shall know them”. BYU, the people, the attendees, the presenters, visiting Apostles, and the spirit of learning by study & also by faith- serves as a walking testament. The fruits of the gospel are beautiful.

I was able to sleep at a nearby friend’s home which significantly reduces the cost to a person traveling. ,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Moderately Influenced,Female,46,California,Ananda,Abremness@gmail.com,It’s all great! ,5

These subjects are deeply relevant to our daily lives and could benefit greatly from the perspective offered by the Book of Mormon.  Additionally, while some of these types of classes were available, they were often located in buildings on the periphery of campus, making them less accessible to many attendees. Distributing these classes more evenly across campus could enhance participation and engagement.  I also propose the introduction of more unconventional and unique classes that connect religious principles with modern-day interests. For instance, courses like ""The Spirituality of Music Genres,"" ""The Gospel According to Pop Culture,"" or even something more playful like ""Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse: A Metaphor for Spiritual Preparedness"" could attract a wide audience. Hands-on classes such as an ""Escape Room: Book of Mormon Edition"" could also provide interactive and memorable learning experiences.

Specifically: 1--Include the series titles in the details for each class. It was a little confusing to review the printed booklet where series titles were featured and then switch the mobile app which only showed specific class titles.  2--Reduce the clicks to add a class to your calendar by removing the ""Would you like a reminder?"" prompt. My suggestion is to make that a global setting that can be edited on a class-by-class basis once it's been added to the user's calendar.  3--Create the ability to add an entire series to your calendar. At three clicks per class (including the conflicting class warning) times four classes per series, the steps to add an entire series to your calendar requires a lot of clicking!  4--With many interesting choices occurring at the same time, I found the process of selecting class very overwhelming. While it is a ""good problem,"" I struggled to find an approach to making decisions. I was consistently wanting more information. For example:  a) How many years has the presenter taught at Education Week? b) How many other Education Week attendees have added the class to their calendar? c) What is the presenter's average rating from past Education Week sessions taught? (I realize this one is problematic, but it was really difficult to decide where to go when there a 6-8 classes that all seem interesting at the same time.) c) What is the capacity of the room in which the session is held? (From within the mobile app. I saw that information in the printed booklet and assumed that popular classes or presenters were strategically placed in the larger capacity rooms.) d) A 2-3 sentence abstract or description for each class. I noted that this is required in the proposal to teach and providing something more than just the series and class titles would really help to get a sense for what will be covered. e) A PDF of the presenter's slides and any other relevant class references. A quick glance of any slide content or related class materials would provide a sense for what will be covered.  5--Provide the class materials, most often a PDF of the slides but could include links to talks or books or other materials referenced, for download via the app and/or website.

Charging $5.00 for the same bottle of water or soda that sells for $2.00 at the Wilkenson Center or in vending machines on campus is a little frustrating.","As a first-time attendee, I loved Education Week! As a BYU alum, it was nostalgic to be back on campus taking classes in a familiar setting and pattern as my university experience many, many years ago. As a Church member, I loved spending 6-8 hours a day immersed in gospel-centered instruction. My testimony has been strengthened as I learned new things, saw certain scriptures in a new light, and felt an overall renewed desire to improve my own gospel scholarship and commitment to discipleship of Jesus Christ.",First time,"My wife has attended many times and routinely encouraged me to go, but life always seemed too busy to make it work. This year, I made it a priority and was greatly blessed as a result of attending. I hope to make this an annual event from here on out!",Slightly Influenced,Strongly Influenced,Moderately Influenced,Moderately Influenced,Strongly Influenced,Male,55,Illinois,,,"A few improvements in the mobile app would be very helpful. Specifically: 1--Include the series titles in the details for each class. It was a little confusing to review the printed booklet where series titles were featured and then switch the mobile app which only showed specific class titles.  2--Reduce the clicks to add a class to your calendar by removing the ""Would you like a reminder?"" prompt. My suggestion is to make that a global setting that can be edited on a class-by-class basis once it's been added to the user's calendar.  3--Create the ability to add an entire series to your calendar. At three clicks per class (including the conflicting class warning) times four classes per series, the steps to add an entire series to your calendar requires a lot of clicking!  4--With many interesting choices occurring at the same time, I found the process of selecting class very overwhelming. While it is a ""good problem,"" I struggled to find an approach to making decisions. I was consistently wanting more information. For example:  a) How many years has the presenter taught at Education Week? b) How many other Education Week attendees have added the class to their calendar? c) What is the presenter's average rating from past Education Week sessions taught? (I realize this one is problematic, but it was really difficult to decide where to go when there a 6-8 classes that all seem interesting at the same time.) c) What is the capacity of the room in which the session is held? (From within the mobile app. I saw that information in the printed booklet and assumed that popular classes or presenters were strategically placed in the larger capacity rooms.) d) A 2-3 sentence abstract or description for each class. I noted that this is required in the proposal to teach and providing something more than just the series and class titles would really help to get a sense for what will be covered. e) A PDF of the presenter's slides and any other relevant class references. A quick glance of any slide content or related class materials would provide a sense for what will be covered.  5--Provide the class materials, most often a PDF of the slides but could include links to talks or books or other materials referenced, for download via the app and/or website.
