3,Utah,5,,,
4,Utah,5,Good mix of spiritual and other interests. ,,
5,Utah,5,I would appreciate longer and more detailed descriptions on what the classes will be about and more information about the teachers.,,
6,Texas,5,Brown route shuttles from the Marriott! The overflow for ‚Äúthe chosen‚Äù classes were rough but overall most classes have the space permitted. ,,
7,Utah,2,Make it less woke.,,
8,Utah,5,When I was younger the classes helped me as a mother and also gave me the spiritual uplift I needed. I am way older now but still need the knowledge and testimonies given . There is also something strengthening about just being surrounded by all those attending who are striving to learn more and become more like the Savior. I still Ned that at any age,,
9,Utah,5,Get a ride up the hill from helaman halls to the buildings.  Ha!,,
10,Arizona,5,Less fire alarms being pulled.,,
11,Utah,5,"I was very disappointed by the political comments that Jeff R. Segelke continuously made during his presentation on Wednesday at BYU Education Week. Throughout the presentation he continued to blame problems like inflation on what happened 3-1/2 years ago ""because we all know what happened 3-1/2 years ago.‚Äù The comment was made multiple times. It was not good.",,
12,Utah,4,If the description more closely matches the content.,,
13,Arizona,5,Our friends had been before and recommended it.    We retired so we had the time. ,,
14,Utah,5,There was no overflow classroom in the conference building so we had to miss.,,
15,Utah,5,"Please consider some additional food trucks by the Marriott Center, if possible.  It would be nice to have choices other than a hamburger and fries.",,
16,Michigan,5,It has changed me forever! I loved every class I attended!,,
17,California,5,More details about the class!!!,,
18,Arizona,5,I had a couple of friends who had been going and decided to join them. They spoke so highly of it. ,,
19,Utah,4,A 2-3 class option. I went from 3-5:30 and had 2 classes but had to get a full day because it crossed over to 2 sessions.,,
20,Utah,4,,,
21,Utah,5,Can‚Äôt think of anything ,,
22,Utah,4,,,
23,Utah,4,More classes on doctrine and easier access.  Construction made for long walks. Hard to make some classes on time.  ,,
24,Utah,5,,,
25,Oregon,5,,,
26,Utah,5,love to learn,,
27,Oregon,5,The focus on learning more about what the scriptures and prophets have taught.  The instructors are well chosen. It has helped me feel spiritually energized.,,
28,Utah,5,A map on rooms in the Wilkinson Center and which outside doors are closest to use for the class.  ,,
29,Utah,5,Classes being held in buildings that were a little closer together. :) I get you have to use the whole campus. And I appreciate the busses! Just wondered sometimes at the choice of buildings used this year that were a little further apart than last year.  ,,
30,Nevada,5,I had time off and was invited by extended family,,
31,Arizona,5,It has definitely left a lasting imprint of wanting to draw nearer to the Savior and fortify myself against sin and unbelief.  It has also just brought more joy into my life!,,
32,Utah,5,a little more time between classes to get cross across campus.,,
33,Utah,5,More food options at the Marriott Center. More reasonable prices. ,,
34,Utah,5,Some classes were much too popular for the facilities provided. Perhaps they could be better matched.,,
35,Utah,5,Movement from place to place especially when the classes were in buildings far from one another was difficult. ,,
36,Utah,5,Nothing to recommend. ,,
37,Utah,5,Everything was excellent. ,,
38,Utah,5,It was great. However the concert in the evening - vocal point and noteworthy were terrible. We left after 4 songs. The lighting was bright lights shining in our eyes and the sound was off,,
39,Utah,5,Seriously it was just perfect!,,
40,Utah,5,Faith renewed! ,,
41,California,5,less people... maybe you should have it twice a year with half the people,,
42,Utah,5,,,
43,Utah,4,"The bus system being centralized at the moa was extremely inconvenient, Especially for those who have difficulty walking long distances. The old system of having buses that go to the Wilkinson  Center and along the upper west Road was far more convenient.  Some class choices were made because getting to the Marriott center took too much walking to get to the MOA which was close to the Marriott, but uphill is a hard walk. Personally, it took me one hour to get from the Wilkinson Center to my car at the Marriott center in the middle of the day when I had an errand to run. I enjoyed the classes. I attended very much! I found them uplifting and encouraging.  Staff did a good job of finding overflow for classes that needed it.  ",,
44,Utah,5,,,
45,Utah,5,I know the classes will be good and it‚Äôs a tradition to go with my daughter ,,
46,Utah,5,Topics and speakers,,
47,Utah,2,Smaller classes ,,
48,Utah,4,Just keep doing what you're doing.  ,,
49,Utah,5,Put John Hilton in the Marriot Center,,
50,Utah,5,Less walking to the various presentations!,,
51,Utah,4,"Either get rid of the rule for no saving seats, or get rid of the people who do. ",,
52,Utah,3,I on l y went 1 day and learned on my last visit that the Marriott center is the best guarantee of a quality class but I was a bit disappointed this time.  The topics were not really what I was looking for but Anthony Sweat was great,,
53,Utah,4,Food choices Temporal Preparedness class Ed week bags Chosen class in bigger venue More food choices at Marriot,,
54,Utah,5,Education week every 6 monthsü§£,,
55,Nevada,5,,,
56,Arizona,5,Being younger,,
57,Utah,5,Love it all ,,
58,Utah,4,The classes could be in buildings closer together. Not so much walking. ,,
59,Utah,4,"Some speakers were boring, others were fantastic.",,
60,California,5,My cup is filled having experienced the light and knowledge that was ever present in each of the classes I attended.,,
61,Alberta,5,In the family housing the recreation room was only open on the main floor.  The 3 other recreation rooms remained locked.  It would have been nice to be able to access the recreation room for relaxing on couches and such without having to go down to the main floor.,,
62,Utah,4,"More specifics on each class. I found some class titles piqued my interest, but the class veered off differently that I had hoped.   Also, if presenters could take 5 minutes max to introduce their topic, I would have enjoyed several classes more. In some instances they spent half the class introducing or summarizing previous days. It was frustrating and I felt like I was wasting my time in those classes. ",,
63,Utah,5,"I would love if there were a paragraph description of each class online. Sometimes I will go to a class and it‚Äôs not what I thought it was and that can be frustrating to feel like I am wasting my time. The titles and descriptions in the booklet are not that long and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to understand what is going to be taught.  Also, this time I had an injury that made walking difficult and I would have loved more shuttles to get me closer to classes.  I would also love to see the Cannon Center have extended hours for lunch. We seemed to have missed it when we would finally break for lunch. Maybe til 2:30 pm. Also to have a shuttle to the Cannon Center would be really nice.  I would also love on the first day of there were more places to pick up my badge. I waited in line for 45 minutes to an hour and it would have been nice to have more options of places to pick it up on that super busy day.  Also one of the days I had to wait 30 minutes to get a shuttle at West Stadium and so I ended up missing a lot of the 9:50 class I was trying to get to. ",,
64,Utah,5,"More food choices. The cougar eat is too crowded and lines are really long. The grab and go food is great, maybe just spread out around campus?",,
65,Alberta,5,Better sound quality in the Wilkinson  Center Ballroom.  Expand the parking‚Ä¶.perhaps the music building or law building parking lot.  ,,
66,Utah,4,"I paid 40$ for one day and had an emergency and had to leave early I would‚Äôve come back, but I didn‚Äôt wanna have to pay another $40. Just wondering if there‚Äôs a way to make it not so expensive.",,
67,Arizona,5,,,
68,Arizona,5,Keep looking for engaging presenters. We love Eggett and Hunsaker! Wish you had more presenters like them.,,
69,Utah,5,"I feel spiritually energized and motivated to be more patriotic (Tad R. Callister), to be more committed to understanding the priesthood (Anthony Sweat), and to learn more and be more professional and responsible (CLE courses). I feel a deeper sense of gratitude for my professional colleagues (CLE Courses). ",,
70,Virginia,5,Some of the rooms were warm.,,
71,Utah,5,More variety of classes.  Focuses on men‚Äôs mental health ,,
72,Texas,5,Recommendations ,,
73,Utah,5,,,
74,Utah,5,Get Jared Halverson a bigger room :),,
75,Utah,5,Some frustration with sessions in Wilkinson Center and JSB Auditoriums that went to overflow broadcasts.  Wondering if there is another venue that could seat in the thousands (such as Smith Field House) where larger gatherings could reduce the number of these situations.,,
76,California,5,"A couple of the instructors spent a lot of time making the class more of a seminary or institute experience (which they were good at, but this isn't seminary or institute) - was looking more for a lecture and information, so that I could then go home and use as study and learning material.  Looking for their insights.  (when they did go to discussion mode - the class usually went off topic and off the rails)",,
77,Utah,5,Every year I attend the classes presented by my favorite educators and then attend ones that are new to me. I am never disappointed and always enjoy the learning experience. I am an LDS Endorsed Chaplain and I am able to use what I have learned to enrich my ministry.,,
78,Missouri,5,My friend and I are in our 70‚Äôs and have been attending together for many many years. As we‚Äôre getting older it would be nice to have a  parking lot -that is close to campus- for senior citizens. ,,
79,Utah,5,Keep the food court open longer.,,
80,Utah,5,"PLEASE don‚Äôt let teachers ask for thoughts, opinions, or questions. I pay for the teachers knowledge. I hate it when they allow anyone to comment. It always gets out of hand. Before the classes start they always read a little reminder. I think an addition to the reminder should be not to make comments and ask questions to the teachers privately afterwards. And then PLEASE say ‚Äúcheck that your phone is silenced right now AND that your alarms are turned off.‚Äù This year I‚Äôve never heard so many people‚Äôs alarms going off! It was always older people getting phone calls and alarms.",,
81,Utah,4,Going everyday!,,
82,Utah,5,"having a class schedule in an app, that didn't need to have internet access the whole time.",,
83,Utah,5,"I would love to see more classes on classic literature! Jane Austen, Bront√´ sisters, etc.",,
84,Utah,5,Can't think of anything right now.,,
85,Missouri,5,Perhaps a bit more detail from the presenters about the content of their classes. Some of the titles did not accurately describe the content. ,,
86,Utah,5,Learning opportunities in a number of areas.,,
87,Utah,5,"Several of the classes that I attended were too full and with people saving seats even though I was 15 minutes early.  Sitting in the satellite rooms is just a totally different experience and EVERY single time that I had to sit in a satellite room (5 times total) there were audio, visual,  or some kind of technical failure. It just really ruins the quality of education week to sit in a satellite room to a talk,  especially when you can't hear the speaker. It just seems like the technical quality and staff/help is really quite poor.    Also,  more parking available.  It's only for 1 week,  I wish byu would open up the parking options more for that week.  ",,
88,Utah,4,To have one more shuttle stop from the Wilkinson Center to the Conference Center and or other remote parts of Campus. I am sure that is harder to do with construction going on. ,,
89,Utah,5,"I felt like there were so many of the classes that were so good it was hard to pick.  I think some of the sessions should be held in the conference center, like Jared Halverson.",,
90,Washington,5,More activity rooms opened up rather than just the first floor room. ,,
91,Virginia,5,I wish I could be in 2 places at one time! Too many great class options to choose from.,,
92,Utah,3,Bigger venues for popular speakers. Maybe limit number of attendees?,,
93,Utah,5,It would be nice if some of the more popular speakers had bigger rooms and if the overflow situations were more organized,,
94,Utah,4,I miss not being able to take notes in my schedule on the app,,
95,Utah,5,Really nothing !  It was great !,,
96,Utah,4,"I couldn't hear very well, and I certainly couldn't see the instructors' displays over the heads of the people sitting in front of me.  Some of them wore big floppy hats which made it even harder to see.  ",,
97,Utah,5,,,
98,Minnesota,5,"I felt like the classes were spread far apart. Maybe because of the construction on Harris Fine Arts building. But trying to get from JSB to Conf center was doable but not easy. So, I altered my class schedule to accommodate. Maybe when Harris Fine Arts is open the Conf Center/Marriott Center won‚Äôt be necessary. ",,
99,Washington,5,Maybe more signage with arrows or volunteers outside to help direct traffic for at least the first couple days as people are learning to navigate campus.,,
100,Utah,4,We usually stay at the Marriott Center all the time and have enjoyed the classes immensely.  This year only 1 class held out interest Anthony Sweat. ,,
101,Utah,4,"The write up of classes are often misleading.  Often the classes are not anything like the write up.  That makes choosing very difficult.  Sometimes it is the classes I find by mistake that turn out to be the best fit for me.  I went to a class on Easter, for instance, and it didn't say that it was actually targeted for young mothers with small children and that ideas and photos for food and games were going to be a large part of the content.  I mistakenly thought it would be more of an intellectual/historical discussion like the class with Lynda Cherry that I took two years ago.  I have such a hard time finding the right classes - lots of walking and trial and error.  I enjoyed the classes by Merrilee Boyack.  I found her by walking into a another class too early and realized that she was who I wanted to listen to that week.",,
102,Utah,5,Better eating options for lunch.  Copies of slides from presenters.,,
103,Mississippi,4,Previous years that we have attended.,,
104,Utah,4,I'm not a fan of political jabs by various presenters. ,,
105,Idaho,5,,,
106,Utah,5,Maybe a review system for classes or teachers. ,,
107,Washington,5,"I learned so much from the classes, and even if I don't remember the exact words from every class I remember the spirit that I felt.",,
108,California,5,Can't think of anything to improve,,
109,Utah,5,Lots of new goals to work on!,,
110,Utah,5,"I would love to see some classes that address loving and teaching our LGBTQ youth. I felt like there were very few options. Also loved the classes on supporting kids through faith crisis, but hoping for more content in that area next year as it was extremely valuable!!!",,
111,Utah,5,"The ushers were very aggressive in not letting you save seats for Scott Braithwaite's class in the conference center. I arrived 10 mins early and my family was saving me a seat and I had to be very firm just to get into the room. One of the ladies begrudgingly let me in and said ""What would Jesus do?"" He would want me to sit next to my family!  The ushers were also aggressive about moving people's bags off seats, even if those people were just using the restroom. Overall an odd experience but the class was great.",,
112,Arizona,5,Just keep the classes and dorms a little warmer. I felt like I was in a meat locker .,,
113,Virginia,5,I would like to be able to eat in the room. It would be helpful to have tables to write on. The chairs aggravate my back problems - they are designed for younger people. More elevators would be helpful for those who have limited mobility. ,,
114,Arizona,5,"Everything was outstanding, not only were the speakers and the classes all of them worthwhile. If I could attend all of them, I would.",,
115,Texas,5,"Nothing, it was amazing.  ",,
116,Utah,5,friends invited me to come with them,,
117,Ontario,5,"Renewed and revitalized my spiritual side. Reawakened in my a desire for all things holy and the power of being around so many good like minded people with such light and love.  Helped me feel like I can better face the challenges my life includes and this particularly difficult upcoming year will be. I had felt so overwhelmed, stressed and lacking in hope. But left Ed week with tools, motivation and faith to handle it. The opportunities for increased knowledge and learning about the scriptures, the Saviour, relationships and psychology were particularly impactful and appreciated. Being from Eastern Canada were members are few, the chance to see an apostle was a thrill. Thanks Ed week for an absolutely amazing experience ",,
118,Texas,5,good maps,,
119,Utah,5,I enjoy sharing this experience with my two granddaughters. I love specific classes that fit my interests or needs. ,,
120,Utah,5,Put Jared Halverson in the Marriott Center.,,
121,Alberta,5,Booklets of classes sent to us before we arrived at education week. We could have been better prepared.,,
122,Utah,5,"In large venues like the Wilkinson center ballroom, it would help for the speaker to have a better microphone and talk more slowly. Reverberation makes it difficult to hear, depending on where you sit. Also, presenters repeat questions asked by audience members so all can hear instead of just responding as if the questioner and presenter were in a private conversation. ",,
123,Utah,4,Two classes of the six I attended had mics fail on the instructors. People scrambled around but took 15 - 30 minutes to get mics working both times. This is a big waste for the instructor and all the people who are attending the classes. Please get your technology in order. Have extra mics or batteries or whatever is needed to fix such problems right away. What you are doing now is not working.,,
124,Utah,5,Can‚Äôt think of a thing.,,
125,Utah,5,Some of the rooms were stuffy and hot. Probably partly because the speaker was popular and the room was overcrowded. Keep to room capacity and plan on overflow rooms.,,
126,Utah,5,"I am so sorry Susan Easton Black was sick and couldn‚Äôt be there, I really wanted to hear her content and know there were a lot of people who wanted too. If she could record her message when she is feeling better, could you have that for people to access who attended education week? That would be wonderful! ",,
127,Utah,3,Younger and more dynamic speakers in the MC,,
128,California,5,Need to have classes for Mid single adults. I saw options for YSA but nothing for 35-45 yos. Mid singles travel for conferences and I‚Äôm sure more would come to Ed week if there were classes for them,,
129,Utah,4,"Not so many secular topics. More doctrinally based presentations like understanding the temple liturgy, the power of prayer, accessing the atonement..etc.",,
130,Utah,5,better parking and shuttles,,
131,New York,5,I think you should bring back senior pricing,,
132,Utah,5,Nothing!,,
133,Arizona,5,I always feel the spirit and I learn so much about my Savior.,,
134,Utah,5,,,
135,Utah,5,"A few lecturers were sub par and just read their remarks. Overall, many presentations were excellent.",,
136,Utah,5,"I have not been to education week for almost 45 years. I really don't think there is anything you can change, it ran so smoothly. The shuttle service (once I figured it out lol) was wonderful and helped SO much so I didn't have to walk so much. Great job your guys!",,
137,Arizona,5,Put some of the newer popular presenters in the larger venues so we won‚Äôt be in multiple overflow rooms.  For example‚Äî Jared Halverson and. Ryan Eggett,,
138,Utah,5,"My sister and I went for years and I hadn‚Äôt been in a few years so I met her there. Hope to see more young mothers there in the future. There used to be a good variety of age groups attending, but now it seems to be mostly 55+. Of course I‚Äôm so glad that they are going, but it would be great to see younger generations continually attending. Maybe marketing could lean toward that idea; suggesting it becomes a tradition with young mothers to make it a priority to go every year. (I know that this week in August on campus is tricky. Thank you for all you're doing to continually make the program excellent!)  Last thing- Merrillee Boyack (spelling?) has ALWAYS needed a bigger venue. She‚Äôs fantastic and this is the age group that she draws in. She‚Äôs always needed overflow, at least every time I‚Äôve gone to her class. She needs the ballroom or a larger hall. Just a suggestion. (Everyone says this when we are fighting for seats in there.)",,
139,Utah,5,,,
140,Utah,5,Nothing,,
141,Washington,4,Overflow rooms prepared in advance to verify slides can seen and instructors heard. ,,
142,Wyoming,5,This was my first time attending so potentially changing my preparation for the experience would have made things smoother.  That would involve me doing my research on topics/map and so on.   ,,
143,California,5,Provide married housing.,,
144,Utah,4,More parking.  Less walking for older people.      Buses were way too crowded and wait lines way too long.   Sometimes we would miss part of our class.  ,,
145,Utah,5,You scheduled the philosophy class with Van Dyk at the same time as Dupree's class on other faith traditions.  These were related subjects and you should have spread them out so that people could attend both.  ,,
146,Utah,4,Put Jared Halverson earlier in the day and in the Marriot!!!!,,
147,Idaho,4,The over flow rooms had trouble every day with the feed. The conference room especially was bad. They would not open overflow until all seats were taken. Including saved seats!! Ended up being three rooms ,,
148,Georgia,5,Excellent instructors and huge choice of classes . Too much choice!!,,
149,Utah,5,"In the Marriott Center, I wish a camera showed the speaker on the big screens.  More bathrooms for the women please.      ",,
150,Utah,4,Emphasize to instructors that if they are going to have attendees participate in large classes they need to have mikes available or at least repeat what they have said for the 3/4 of the room that can not hear them. ,,
151,Idaho,5,More options for parking. I got frustrated with all the no education week parking signs. Making it legal to park in all parking lots. It would be so nice if you held it at byu i again. I loved it there,,
152,Utah,5,"Do not automatically assign the larger meeting places to ""name"" speakers.  I attended two presentations each day that were equal to if not better than the presenters in, for example, the Ball Room in the Student Center, and this when one presenter in the Ball room was clearly not as engaging as a presenter in a smaller venue.",,
153,Arizona,5,It was an incredible week.  Thank you for investing so much into affordable continuing education.,,
154,Utah,5,,,
155,Arizona,4,"I would have the wheelchair lifts in working order on all the shuttle buses. My sister was in a wheelchair and the only transportation we could get was one little van that serviced the whole entire education week experience. Not very good planning. We were not able to get to the classes we wanted to go to because when you‚Äôre pushing a wheelchair, it‚Äôs way too far to walk. Not one of the shuttle buses had a wheelchair lift that was working. And there were many other people in the same situation.",,
156,Utah,5,Attending Education Week helped me to better answer some questions that I've been thinking about for some time. It is good to get an educated perspective on gospel topics to know how I can better function in my family.,,
157,Utah,4,I did it with my parents this year. A common theme was the presenters had so much material that they needed to move through some slides quickly. I was able to follow along but my parents and their friends who are in their 60's & 70's had a really hard time following. The presenters need to slow it down a little bit. They maybe use to teaching young college students but the older attendees that come need the presenters to slow down. My parents and their friends love the classes but a common item of feedback I heard from them is I wish the presenters didn't click through the slides so fast and I wish they would speak up and slow down a little bit. ,,
158,Utah,4,Put Jon Hilton in a larger room. Like in the Marriott center. Also Avram Shannon needs to be in a larger room,,
159,Idaho,3,Makes slides available for download. It was kind of distracting having dozens of people in every class constantly hold up their phone or tablet to take pictures of the slides. Some of those devices even made a sound each time. If slides could be downloaded then people could just take minimal notes and focus on the speaker.,,
160,Texas,5,"So many of the popular speakers were all scheduled at the same time, I'd love for those to be spread throughout the day, not just first thing in the morning.",,
161,Utah,4,Is there a better system for filling seats in the classrooms? People sit on the ends and we always have to crawl over them and their baggage to get to an empty seat in the middle. Then the hosts closes the second door when the class starts so latecomers are compelled to crawl over everyone to get to a seat on the side of the closed door. This was very distracting and frustrating. ,,
162,Utah,5,"So many elderly attended, including myself.  IF we did not formerly study at BYU, we didn't know WHERE the buildings were, in spite of the printed maps in the catalog. Had to stop and ask everywhere I went. Could you improve that for us?  One idea might be - as we EXIT a certain building, put wire stakes into the grass, to hold ARROWs this was to xyz building, THIS way to abc building, etc.  Or have some volunteer stand outside the exit doors of buildings so we can ASK someone who knows ?  Also - the BYU Bookstore had employees to check out, but not many to ASK where can I find such and such item?   MORE time for we elders to get between classes. 25 minutes was NEVER enough. I would suggest 45. I realize that may cut down on classes offered.......  The catalog mailed to my home address had SOOOOO many errors. SO glad someone realized it and got CORRECT ones printed on site.   ",,
163,Utah,5,,,
164,Colorado,5,"If the presenters could have copies of their slides to hand out so that I could take more notes rather than trying to take photos of the slides and take note, that would be SOOOOOO helpful!",,
165,Utah,4,More signs to buildings,,
166,Utah,5,,,
167,Arizona,5,My testimony is so ,,
168,Utah,5,"More classes on classical Literature, and Music.  The shuttle service is great and the time schedule is super. I would like to make a comment on the Scott Marsh class which was on Monday entitled ""America's Finance Future....."".    I feel he gave a seriously false impression about our nation's financial situation and what is happening in the world regarding the economy.   He claimed that the inflation rate is 8% and he should know that the government rate DOES NOT show the inflation of food and gas.   He encouraged the reading of ""The Deficit Myth"" which I checked and it says nothing  against the out of control government printing money with nothing to back it up.  That is a main cause of our terrible inflation rate.   It is out of control.  He gave positive statement of leaders' involved in the economy who are really showing irresponsibility in regards to their roles in our economy.   He did give a few statements from church leaders but I feel those speeches referred to the miracles and growth in regards to the Church and the Gospel.",,

173,Utah,5,"Emphasize even more strongly that patrons should not interrupt speakers with comments or questions.  I came to hear speakers not patrons.  That may sound harsh, but several speakers were rushed or unable to finish because of interruptions. ",,
174,Utah,4,more seating at popular classes.,,

189,Utah,5,"I realize there's no big rooms available because of the lack of the HFAC, but Bro Eggett needs to be in a bigger classroom. And the HC could use entrance and exit signs to help direct traffic.  More afternoon/evening classes",,

191,Georgia,5,"-Helaman Halls needs to be bulldozed. Not crazy about the communal bathrooms. -Put small refrigerators in the rooms at Heritage Halls, just like the ones in Helaman Halls.  -The Cannon Center experience was OK but the salad bar always looked like a war zone. Not very sanitary. And sometimes it seems like they ran out of certain dishes very early, resulting in a limited selection. -The course topics were good. However some rooms were not nearly big enough to accommodate the attendees.  Overflow rooms are no better than staying at home and watching it online. -Did not like having to travel all the way up to the Conference Center building. -it seems like many of the topics in the course syllabus are the same from year to year. Perhaps we need some new topics. Please consider having someone speak on the topic of ‚ÄúThe Father Wound.‚Äú",,
192,Washington,4,"Please make actual on campus parking for attendees available. Please don‚Äôt spread the classes so far apart- it was impossible to get from one end of the campus to the next on time.  PLEASE select presenters for the youth program who are extremely energetic engaging and enthusiastic. I attended a few classes with my sons and the presentations were not enjoyable. I also think several of the adult classes were very appropriate and would have been fantastic for youth to attend, giving them the option of a few other classes would be so helpful!",,
193,Utah,5,"The long stairway inbetween the RV parking lot and the campus buildings?  It would be so nice to have a bench to sit on, after you climb that flight of stairs!  Middle age and senior people would climb the stairs, then stand to catch their breath.  No bench in sight to sit on, and the heat was in the upper 80's and 90's.  Just a thought!",,
194,Utah,5,Mint brownies at the cannon center everyday ,,

196,Utah,5,I continue to learn and grow spiritually as I absorb the wonderful things I learn every year at Ed Week.  It is so spiritually uplifting!,,
197,Utah,4,"There were lots of people, so classes were often full. There was overflow, which was nice. Also parking. There wasn't parking, which was hard both as a person living in Provo and also as someone attending education week. If there's a way to open up parking that would be amazing!!! ",,
198,Utah,5,It took 3 days for them to get the sound system in MARB 121 working properly.,,
199,Utah,5,If classes were more easily accessible  ,,
