Reawakened in my a desire for all things holy and the power of being around so many good like minded people with such light and love.  Helped me feel like I can better face the challenges my life includes and this particularly difficult upcoming year will be. I had felt so overwhelmed, stressed and lacking in hope. But left Ed week with tools, motivation and faith to handle it. The opportunities for increased knowledge and learning about the scriptures, the Saviour, relationships and psychology were particularly impactful and appreciated. Being from Eastern Canada were members are few, the chance to see an apostle was a thrill. Thanks Ed week for an absolutely amazing experience ",5,positive,positive

However, I was shocked at some of the false doctrine being pushed in Avram Shannon's classes and Jan Martin's class (e.g., men's priesthood offices are essentially irrelevant since women have full priesthood power, single people will be exalted, WE establish Zion when we give all our stuff to poor people, Lehi's family was enslaved by other groups while traveling in the Arabian peninsula).   The other disappointment was all the religion classes that appealed to emotion and that indulged feelings of victimhood or entitlement instead of looking at sound, doctrinally based answers (that is the best way that I can describe it). I sat through a class about how the temple helps me become like Jesus Christ, but the last thing presented was a poem from a former atheist who tried to smash the phone and get rid of it but finally answered it, and God was on the other side saying, ""I love you"" or something like that. Like, this was utter appeal to pathos was fairly sickening given all that President Nelson and Church leaders have said about our need to be in the temple and receiving revelation there.

For example, the class ""Coming Closer to Jesus Christ through The Chosen"" was wildly popular and really should have been held in the Marriott Center. Additionally, the class ""Finding Faith in Temple Worship"" was also quite popular, and I ended up in the overflow almost every time. I wouldn't mind the overflow if it wasn't for all the issues that came with broadcasting the class via Zoom. Transitions between the slide deck and the classroom camera always lagged by several minutes, and the audio from the instructor's computer was not connected, and so those in the overflow couldn't hear the video/audio clips that were being played. Attendance in an overflow classroom was therefore quite inferior to attending in the actual auditorium.  The vast majority of the Education Week instructors were excellent. There were a couple instructors, however, that I found dissatisfying. The first was John L.

I'd like to suggest ways to mitigate them.   1. Copyrighted Material - Presenters could be required to submit their presentations prior to EW. They could be required to remove copyrighted material from slide decks which are made available to attendees.  Additionally AI could be used to also double-check presentations for images or text that is copyrighted.  This is especially maddening with content from religious courses. Th  2.

I did ""attend"" the 2020 online Education Week when on campus was canceled due to COVID.  When my kids were young my husband would take the week off from work and be with the kids so I could attend. As they turned 14 I would bring them with me so they could attend. After they grew and left on missions, college and marriage, my husband attended with me.  For me Education week helped me with parenting skills when kids were young,  and later in helping me stay the course in scripture and general conference study.  Now that I am older, I still enjoy coming and learning more about the Savior and our Church history, and other topics offered during the week. My husband's and my second mission was the Missouri Independence Mission where we were Historical Site Missionaries at Liberty Jail so I enjoy the Church History classes.  My husband passed a few years ago and classes on grieving were also helpful.  I now attend with friends. I love the things I learn and work to incorporate what I learn into my life. I always run into friends and extended family members I have not seen for quite awhile, which adds to the fun of the week.",Over 20,"I have enjoyed going to Education week for many years although I must admit I am taking the elevator more often than I used to!

I think even more of these would be great! â¢  Walking all the way through Heritage to get up to the Harmon and Conference buildings was a challenge.  Are there any other large size meeting spaces closer to the rest of campus that could be used instead?  We made the trek up there for a couple of classes, but would have participated in more of those classes if they just hadn't been so far away.  It was a deterrent for those presenters. â¢  Clearly ""The Chosen"" presentation was way more popular than expected.  With like 6 overflow rooms?  That one should have been in the Marriott Center.  Can he please come do that again?  We missed out when the room was always full. â¢ Can popular classes be offered more than once during the day?  It's rough when you only get one chance to see someone and it conflicts with something else or is too far away.  If presenters could do their class a couple of times, that would be great! â¢  Specify on the class schedule whether a class is ""self-standing"" or ""series.""  We did more bouncing around, and felt lost in a couple of classes when the presenter would assume you'd been there the previous day.  We would generally like more ""self-standing"" classes so you don't feel like you have to be in that same class every day, but can enjoy a wider variety of topics and presenters. â¢  The BYU employees and volunteer staff members were completely wonderful!

","I was blessed to be accepted as a student in 1988 to BYU as one of 2 ""Mormons"" in my entire high school in Indiana. But this was my first time to ever attend Education Week. I don't know if I quite have the words to describe this experience, but I'll try.  I was taken back 35 years in time as this experience was the SWEET SALVE to my LONGING SOUL and a special HEALING for my BROKEN HEART. My husband and I met at BYU in 1988. After serving missions, we ran into each other again in 1993 at a dance in the Wilk, and the rest is history. We thought we were ""following the recipe"" as returned missionaries, learned in the Gospel, children of adult convert parents, married in the temple, served in the church faithfully, taught our children the Gospel.. and even had a child go on to serve a mission. But over time, it became obvious that we were just going through the motions of discipleship. And then in 2019, my husband became an enemy to the church and my children each followed. I've been navigating life along the iron rod by myself again, like back home in Indiana. Again, I find myself standing as a witness at all times and in all places, even as I stand alone. While staying at the dorms last week, the Lord poured out His tender blessings to me in the form of REMEMBERANCES of my years as a student there, walking this same paths, entering those same buildings, feeling that same power of God that permeates those hallways almost like a penetrating wind from the mountains. Memories of personal manifestations of the Spirit resurfaced from the depths of my senses, carrying with them sweet spiritual healing as well as personal revelation. Familiar images and memories were brought to my mind, heart and soul through His Holy Spirit as I sat in the very same seats in classes where I was nourished by the good word of God with TRUTH during a pivotal point in adulthood... and there I sat at another pivotal point in my life as a disciple of Christ. Rememberances of the sweet savor of His fruits and precious truths literally awakened and enlivened the fibers of my being after having been dormant for years. Impressions were confirmed; truths were witnessed; testimony was strengthened; my broken heart was mended to almost new again; and my spirit humbled to an openness I've missed.  Thank you for continuing to offer this wonderful feast for us old folks! It is my life's desire to now go forth to serve... Also, I would LOVE to present at Education Week someday!

We will meet twice a month and our first meeting is September 3rd.  On Friday, the 23rd, I texted my immediate family, my 1st cousins and as many of my mom's first cousins, that I had contacts for, and asked them to spread the word that I need their help with stories about their families and our ancestors (all non-members) because I am compiling stories for a family history book. I asked for pictures, copies of letters, stories of heirlooms, etc. and got quite a few positive responses!   Kelly Summer's class was amazing.

Hugh Nibley would be rolling over in his grave to see the titles of some of these, like how to get ""more money than you will ever need"". Particularly perplexing was the participation of a Moms for Liberty co-founder, since from my perspective this group is actually hindering education in our country and their website is full of trans-phobic fearmongering, contrary to the principles of the Gospel and the Handbook 38.6.23. There were other session descriptions that also looked like today's culture war talking points mingled with scripture. I feel that BYU providing a platform for this kind of content without any kind of significant counterpoint or debate gives opening to enemies of the Church to call into question its political neutrality.

I left the first class feeling terrible, like I had no power to make decisions and that my life was actually being micro-managed based on the covenants I decide to make. Let me say that I have a very strong testimony, so it didn't shake me at all doctrinally, but his content did make me feel like I was a cog in a wheel, rather than being able to steer that wheel. Also, he is old fashioned and very dated in his approach to homosexuality and shared his opinions on those matters openly with ""side comments"" throughout his lecture. To be honest, I don't think he even knew he was being offensive with what he was saying, which kind of made it worse. In addition, there was someone who made a comment in his class and in response, he was rude and condescending to that person. I felt embarrassed for not only him, but the person who made the comment as well. I attended his first class because the content interested me, but I did not return after that. It was a very uncomfortable class.  Kimberly Parry--The title of her class interested me, but it was an absolute complete waste of my time. She spent the first 20 minutes of the class trying to drill in the punch line from a joke she had made. She was self deprecating and used humor as a way to bouy herself  up through people's laughter, rather than using it as a tool to help her presentation hit home.  It felt like she was trying to be a stand up comedian. She was name dropping and inflating her ego every few minutes or so. There was NO content to her slides or material. I was so disappointed because not only did I really want to know more about what her class series described and there was nothing to take away from it, but I also wasted the hour not being able to go to another class of interest. It was obvious that she was very self-conscious, had imposter syndrome, and felt the need to prove to everyone in her class why she was qualified to be up there teaching. Sadly, in an effort to prove her qualifications, she did more than disprove them, she killed them. I know this is a harsh review, but really, the class was terrible. I didn't return to any of her lectures again.  I like the idea of having a TEDtalk series....where instructors have 15 minutes to make their points and hone their presentations to be concise, informationally potent, and really enjoyable to listen to. This could possibly be in the Marriot Center, so people who can't move well or get to classes easily could be able to sit there and enjoy the presentations. It would also benefit those who are coming for really concentrated presentations where the information is easily presented and easily ingested by the listener. It would also help the presenters as well with being more focused in their material and creating a more streamlined approach to what they are hoping to get out to their audience.

I am a first generation convert, a single mother raising 3 daughters in the gospel, living in California.   I attended BYU for my masters, but life has taken unexpected twists since I lived in Utah, mostly that of a divorce from someone who also left the gospel. This singular event (divorce not of my choosing) sent my testimony in a downward tailspin. Not even the Savior, it seemed, could stop this pain from happening (to me, yes, but moreso to my children).  This week was a much-needed boost to focus on my spiritual connection to the Savior, the Spirit, and to the church (the lens of the church as an administrative organization of humans).   I quite literally walk away feeling cloaked in the full armor of God. My activity level prior to this week âlookedâ like my heart was it it, but truly I had many doubts that were *very* strong. It was very painful at times to think about choosing a path of life where the gospel and church may not have been a part of my future.   I am not exaggerating when I say this event has brought me peace and put my heart mostly at rest, inasmuch as doubts and concerns go.   For context, I enjoy attending all 12 hours, and my best friend from college often attends with me.   Additionally, the finance/estate/investing classes are very valuable and I attend as many as I can. That is an area I feel strong in already, and these add to my current body of knowledge to keep me up to speed.  BYU Ed week has always been enjoyable and uplifting, and this year was the best.   And by the way- of the biggest testimonies I have (and have always held) is that âby their fruits ye shall know themâ. BYU, the people, the attendees, the presenters, visiting Apostles, and the spirit of learning by study & also by faith- serves as a walking testament. The fruits of the gospel are beautiful. ",6â10,Deciding 6 months prior to make it a priority and plan ahead. I was also fortunate to receive financial assistance through a single parentsâ scholarship. I was able to sleep at a nearby friendâs home which significantly reduces the cost to a person traveling. ,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Did not influence at all,Moderately Influenced,Female,46.0,California,Ananda,Abremness@gmail.com,Itâs all great! ,5,positive,positive

However, I believe the experience could be further enriched by incorporating a broader range of class topics that address everyday responsibilities and current societal issues, all through a gospel lens.  For example, more classes on financial planning, mental health, leadership, interfaith dialogue, business-building, cultural responsibilities, environmental stewardship, and interpersonal skills could be invaluable. These subjects are deeply relevant to our daily lives and could benefit greatly from the perspective offered by the Book of Mormon.  Additionally, while some of these types of classes were available, they were often located in buildings on the periphery of campus, making them less accessible to many attendees. Distributing these classes more evenly across campus could enhance participation and engagement.  I also propose the introduction of more unconventional and unique classes that connect religious principles with modern-day interests. For instance, courses like ""The Spirituality of Music Genres,"" ""The Gospel According to Pop Culture,"" or even something more playful like ""Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse: A Metaphor for Spiritual Preparedness"" could attract a wide audience. Hands-on classes such as an ""Escape Room: Book of Mormon Edition"" could also provide interactive and memorable learning experiences.  Lastly, expanding the discussion of current issues in the context of the Book of Mormon could be profoundly impactful.

I'm also eager to meet others who share my faith, as connecting with a supportive community is important to me during this phase of my life. Additionally, I look forward to gaining different perspectives on the gospel, which can offer fresh insights and help me navigate my journey with renewed faith.

I am thankful you are not locked into one class for the whole week.   As a seminary teacher and temple worker, I could not get enough Faith Crisis, current curriculum  and Temple topics. Some were better than others, (2 thumbs up for Grenny, Halverson, Wilson, Hilton (both) Casey Griffith, Daniel Smith, Scott Marsh, T. Fackrell. I'm sure there are others that appreciated their teaching style but if I had been sitting on an aisle at the back for Tyler Johnson and Jennifer Yorgason Thatcher I would have walked out.

There were some that I would have loved to attend but because they were so far north on campus (near MTC or in marriott center) it was too long of a walk for us to make without being completely exhausted when arrived.    In a few classes with well known speakers, there were people up front on the mic before it started telling people to sit down or they would give your seat away which made it difficult for my aging body, especially after we had just sat there for an hour in the previous class and needed some time to move our muscles that had gone to sleep.   Even if we were standing in front of our own seat, we were told we had to sit down for another 10 minutes before we could get up to use the restroom or stretch.  We are all mostly adults and can figure out how to find our own seats without spending 20 minutes listening to something micromanage the audience the whole break (Jared Halvorsen's class in particular) to point out seats for those looking.  Seems like you should be able to leave a personal item on the seat next to your companion and not be threatened that it would be moved by the staff if you went to the bathroom.  The lines for the bathrooms are usually long so only having 10 minutes or less to go after you have been forced to stay in your seats for an extra 10-15 minutes wasn't enough time.    Probably just giving the more popular speakers a bigger room (like the JSB auditorium) to house more people (that doesn't require a long walk to the Marriott center) would solve some of those problems.   ","The speakers were great, and I have a renewed desire to be a better follower of Christ!  My testimony has grown in several areas and even the YSA dating talks I attended with my 21 year old daughter were still relatable to a 52 year old mom and helped me to gain insight on being a better spouse.  As an added bonus, I got to share the experience with my college aged return missionary daughter.  We attended most of the classes together and hit 6-7 each day which was somewhat exhausting but in a good way.  It gave us some great mother/daughter bonding time.  I definitely want to come back again next year if my schedule allows it.

There were some that I would have loved to attend but because they were so far north on campus (near MTC or in marriott center) it was too long of a walk for us to make without being completely exhausted when arrived.    In a few classes with well known speakers, there were people up front on the mic before it started telling people to sit down or they would give your seat away which made it difficult for my aging body, especially after we had just sat there for an hour in the previous class and needed some time to move our muscles that had gone to sleep.
