Also, this time I had an injury that made walking difficult and I would have loved more shuttles to get me closer to classes.  I would also love to see the Cannon Center have extended hours for lunch. We seemed to have missed it when we would finally break for lunch. Maybe til 2:30 pm. Also to have a shuttle to the Cannon Center would be really nice.  I would also love on the first day of there were more places to pick up my badge. I waited in line for 45 minutes to an hour and it would have been nice to have more options of places to pick it up on that super busy day.

I went to a class on Easter, for instance, and it didn't say that it was actually targeted for young mothers with small children and that ideas and photos for food and games were going to be a large part of the content.  I mistakenly thought it would be more of an intellectual/historical discussion like the class with Lynda Cherry that I took two years ago.

He encouraged the reading of ""The Deficit Myth"" which I checked and it says nothing  against the out of control government printing money with nothing to back it up.  That is a main cause of our terrible inflation rate.   It is out of control.

And totally against Power Point rules. üòÜ   Not all class titles reflected the actual lesson - the endocrine system and revelation was very misleading. And had more information about CS Lewis than the CS Lewis class and nothing about the mechanism of action on the endocrine system when spiritual events occur in the body.   Some presenters spent more time talking about themselves and little time in the actual topics.   Classes that had to go to overflow did not always have the connection set up correctly - only seeing one power point slide and not the instructor or other things he was discussing.   Lighting should be adjusted so it is dimmer in the front allowing those in the middle or back to be able to read the screens - particularly when dark colors are used. Things that may look okay in a computer screen should be tested in the classroom for legibility.

Perhaps if hosts could be on the lookout for people who are inappropriately dressed and inviting them to come back when they have covered their bodies, more people would feel comfortable.   Also the titles of the classes can be very misleading.  If there was a more detailed description of what will be covered in the classes it would help in deciding which classes to go to.

A possible speaker might be Lisa Valentine Clark.   Many are experiencing that now and giving to the point of burnout and feeling completely empty and then needing to carry on for family and then rebuild after is super hard.    A class on rebuilding after divorce, not hating the other gender and lumping them all in the same category of people who just hurt and take from your kind.

574,Utah,4,"I think the number one thing that could improve Education Week is having better auditorium and/or overflow options for the popular classes. For example, the class ""Coming Closer to Jesus Christ through The Chosen"" was wildly popular and really should have been held in the Marriott Center. Additionally, the class ""Finding Faith in Temple Worship"" was also quite popular, and I ended up in the overflow almost every time. I wouldn't mind the overflow if it wasn't for all the issues that came with broadcasting the class via Zoom. Transitions between the slide deck and the classroom camera always lagged by several minutes, and the audio from the instructor's computer was not connected, and so those in the overflow couldn't hear the video/audio clips that were being played. Attendance in an overflow classroom was therefore quite inferior to attending in the actual auditorium.  The vast majority of the Education Week instructors were excellent. There were a couple instructors, however, that I found dissatisfying. The first was John L. Hilton III who taught the course for ""Coming Closer to Jesus Christ through The Chosen"", and what bothered me about him was that he promoted himself on multiple occasions by encouraging attendees to follow him on Instagram. I found this very distasteful. The second was Connie E. Sokol who taught ""Studying President Nelson‚Äôs Messages to Think Celestial by Living Our Covenants with Purpose, Practices, and Joy"". What drove me nuts about her was that she directed her class content exclusively to the women in attendance. As a man, I found this very annoying, especially given that the class subject was not designated for a specific gender. Don't get me wrong - I think it would be totally fine for Education Week classes to focus exclusively on women, but the title of the course needs to specify if that that would be the case.

Perhaps a link to the teachers ppt, at least a link to key slides that are noted in the ppt: ""this slide will be provided online in teachers notes"".

712,Utah,5,"Easy.  Change the stupid policy which prevents presenters from sharing their slide decks and contact information.  This policy results in significantly reduced effectiveness of each course as most attendees are more worried about taking a picture of each slide.  Getting the timing correct as slides tend to build out with multiple bullets being added to the slide one at a time.  This results in a great deal of time and worry to just capture the slide instead of focusing on the content that the presenter worked so hard to produce.  I attend EW to increase my spirituality from some outstanding presenters. Being blocked from having reasonable access to their content is maddening!   Additionally, the resulting photos from each slide are difficult to turn into a useful document in order to review them to solidify learning and/or figure out what was missed while the focus was trying to capture the photo or to take notes.  The slide decks should instead be posted on a site accessible to attendees for download/review.    I understand that there are a couple of reasons why presenters can't share their content. I'd like to suggest ways to mitigate them.   1. Copyrighted Material - Presenters could be required to submit their presentations prior to EW. They could be required to remove copyrighted material from slide decks which are made available to attendees.  Additionally AI could be used to also double-check presentations for images or text that is copyrighted.  This is especially maddening with content from religious courses. Th  2. Outside presenters who sell a service - Why the EW organizers might like to pretend that these experts in their respective fields spend preparation time and delivery time due to their kindness, that is likely not the case. Many external presenters have terrific content. Instead of pretending that they don't provide a service that mature/capable attendees might CHOOSE to pursue, EW could instead at least allow them to share contact info even if mentioning specific products/services isn't permitted. I've opted to potentially engage one of the external presenters.  Having to waste so much effort trying to determine contact info for that presenter was frustrating. Instead, I'd prefer to be able to focus as a student in absorbing their advice/teaching.  Making these two changes would GREATLY improve the experience of attending the already terrific EW.

Please, please, please offer the option of having attendees scan a QR code before the presentation - which would allow them to access all of the slides, rather than taking photos.  Maybe just a quick tutorial from the presenter on using that option would be good, since not everyone attending is tech savvy... Let the attendees know how they can have long-term access to those slides (since everyone thinks the only way to do that is by taking a photo.)  And for those not willing to use a QR code, at least have the presenter tell people when the slide is complete.  Lots of people were taking 5 photos along the way, not knowing when the slide was complete and worrying it would be taken down and they'd miss it.  Obviously all the photo taking is driving me crazy :) ‚Ä¢  Its really hard to give up a class time for eating lunch, and the Marriott Center was the only venue that allows food during class.  What about a few more locations where you're allowed to eat while listening?  Or have class overflow options in food-okay locations? ‚Ä¢  Loved that there were more ""grab and go"" food options!  And the lines moved pretty quickly, with a nice variety of menu choices.  I think even more of these would be great! ‚Ä¢  Walking all the way through Heritage to get up to the Harmon and Conference buildings was a challenge.  Are there any other large size meeting spaces closer to the rest of campus that could be used instead?  We made the trek up there for a couple of classes, but would have participated in more of those classes if they just hadn't been so far away.  It was a deterrent for those presenters. ‚Ä¢  Clearly ""The Chosen"" presentation was way more popular than expected.  With like 6 overflow rooms?  That one should have been in the Marriott Center.  Can he please come do that again?  We missed out when the room was always full. ‚Ä¢ Can popular classes be offered more than once during the day?  It's rough when you only get one chance to see someone and it conflicts with something else or is too far away.  If presenters could do their class a couple of times, that would be great! ‚Ä¢  Specify on the class schedule whether a class is ""self-standing"" or ""series.""  We did more bouncing around, and felt lost in a couple of classes when the presenter would assume you'd been there the previous day.

Perhaps better screening? I don't know how BYU would do this because it would be merely impossible to scrutinize every word of a presentation of course.  The class I attended that bothered me some was a Friday class in the Conference (we knew it as students as the Harmon building) where the presenter had us sing along with a YouTube video of a ""revival""-type individual clearly not of our faith. There were individuals in this class singing along with the non-LDS video and waiving their arms in the air like we were indeed at a revival! It was strange and inappropriate in our Education Week setting. The video even had a water-marked crucifix showing on the huge screen. I understand completely those that want to do good. However, I think we should keep our remarks, teachings, presentations, etc. ALL within the Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder-Day Saints teachings and culture. There is no need to influence our culture with outside strangeness when we have so much of our own songs, videos, podcasts, etc. to present. For goodness sake, we have new hymns that the presenter could have used or thousands of new LDS songs to choose from if the presenter was looking for new material!

She was 31 years old and seemed too young to be covering the topic she had chosen. Very limited study or experience in the presentation. Mostly turned to class members to answer her questions.     I realize that BYU teachers and CES employees would typically have the most researched knowledge on particular topics, but gospel application could be anyone. I enjoy just average people who haven't dedicated their careers to religion who speak about how to implement the gospel into an average life (who is not paid to study religion).  I am not against religious instructors coming to education week, they have some great research and study, but they don't always have insights and applications to really live the gospel.

We had a wonderful week and felt the Spirit and learned so much. I was grateful to all the presenters and other people that were so friendly, warm and welcoming.    I am totally bald including eyelashes and eyebrows and but had to endure two different presenters while they were cracking bald jokes and stories at the beginning of their presentations (they had full heads of hair) which made me feel very uncomfortable, especially seated in the middle of hundreds of people. It was comforting, how those sitting adjacent to me were not laughing at the jokes, which I interpreted as empathy for me in those two situations, so that was good.    For some reason, there has always been open season on bald men in the LDS church that I have not encountered in my professional life with non-members.  I don't think anyone said anything to intentionally hurt feelings, but I still didn't think it was appropriate or necessary.

When I told the staff at Ed week about my concern they said it was BYU policy now.  I wish to tell you that it is a CRAZY policy to try to give up the great convenience to students in unfamiliar places that these signs provide for nothing more than  preserving a slightly more dignified look on campus.  It is CRAZY because the campus already looks totally un-dignified with all the huge construction projects going on. These signs would not hurt anything and should be reinstated. People are moving between classes trying to not be late and they have to walk extra distances to confirm the building names by looking for the tiny signs near doors. On top of this, what other kind of visitors are on campus during ED week who would be disturbed by the not-totally-sedate signs? This is not the week to invite prestigious visitors to evaluate the campus.   Please fix this for next year. ",negative,sadness

For example, why can we not hear interesting topics like Ezra's Eagle, or signs of the times theories by multiple thinkers that do not ONLY quote general authorities? These kinds of topics are fascinating and worth studying to many people who already have firm testimonies, but who attend Ed Week to have their minds expanded and enlightened. I'd like to hear Connor Boyack (Merrilee Boyack's son) speak about some of the topics he has discussed in his Sunday Musings series.   I really appreciate multiple classes I attended that deal with the topic of people having faith crises; this is a timely discussion, and we need to find more ways to talk about it, and more resources to support those trying to help family and friends who are grappling with big questions about our church history, doctrine, practices.   I really miss Richard Himmer, who spoke several years ago for several years in a row. His communication classes were excellent.  I would love to see more from Jared Halverson, in a much bigger room.  I love Rob Ferrell! Would love to see more from him. He was scheduled in the first hour this time, so I wasn't able to hear him and regret that.  There are always a few ""badge nazis"", and it really messes with the positive vibe of the whole event! This particular year my badge was on a (campus-gifted) lanyard, which turned around a few times so it wasn't facing out. I had multiple door guards ask me to turn it around, and one even stopped me further, and wanted to read it up close after I flipped it around and kept walking into the room. I assume these are people who take their life responsibilities very seriously --or perhaps need to feel relevant in a world where they usually do not--but I cannot comprehend why a regular person thinks it is helpful to the atmosphere you are trying to cultivate at Ed Week, to stop and carefully go over a patron's badge as they go in and out of classes! I simply cannot believe there is a large number of people who are trying to steal classes they didn't pay for... and if there are literally people who have used their agency to try to sneak in-- perhaps they truly need to be there, where the Spirit can teach them to live in greater integrity! Has this happened? Is it a big problem? Is catching potential ""sneakers-in"" worth being rude to a large number of people who are just going about their business in what is meant to be a more Zion-like bubble? Please tell the hosts that they are not specially-appointed Guards; they are supposed to be HOSTING guests at a fun event. Welcoming them, helping them (but NOT doing things to alienate or make them feel uncomfortable or untrustworthy) is the point of their job.  I have no idea why some years I receive a hard copy of the Ed Week booklet in the mail, while other years I do not. But my sister received hers this year, and I did not, and it was very inconvenient to not be able to see that info (and if she has not received hers, we may have forgotten it was even time to go to Ed Week until it was too late). Surely you could at least send ONE to each address in your files? She received 3, for multiple family members. Finding a way to cut duplicates but hit every address seems like a better way to distribute them. ",positive,trust
1479,Idaho,3,"I used to love Education week. It was my one chance a year to hear insights into the gospel that I would get in a typical sunday school lesson. However, with so many good podcasts out there I feel like I've heard a lot of the content already. I guess that is the blessing of today's technology is that it has made Education week less important to me. I think it might be worth considering how Education week could be different than the podcasts that are already provided in doing deeper dives into doctrine/scripture, application-based and hands on training for secular topics. It is also quite sad how the school districts have changed their schedules and made it so Education week is the same time as the first weeks of school. Some of my favorite memories of being a teenager is listening to John Bytheway and Jack Marshall with my cousins from Utah and getting a spiritual boost before school started again. Maybe not much can be done there, but I feel that is gone. One last complaint, please have the class hosts make an announcement that there aren't any questions during the session, or at least hold questions until the end. Too many classes got hijacked by very specific type of questions that didn't benefit the rest of the class (i.e. ""in my very specific situation, how would this apply?"").

1488,North Carolina,5,"While the majority of the conference was fantastic and uplifting, there were several sessions that I attended where politics and self-promotion reared their ugly head. The most egregious to me was one session that I attended on Finances with Jeff Segelke (sp?). As a current financial regulator for the Federal Government, I took exception with the way that Mr. Segelke presented information. He left out key elements of the material to present facts in a highly misleading manner. For instance, discussing the NIIT as a tax on everyone for Obamacare when the tax only applies to taxpayers exceeding $250,000 in AGI (MFJ). All of these comments seemed designed to make a political argument. At one point, a misinformed member of the class, riled up by his statements, made comments about VP Harris by purposely mispronouncing her first name and complaining about all of these taxes on him that he was learning of during the class. Mr. Segelke, rather than correcting either the facts or the inappropriate purposeful mispronunciation of the current VP, simply offered, ""Who is this Mr. Harris of which you refer"". In another one of my classes, the teacher had shared a BYU Studies talk that focused on teaching to our young members. In that talk, he cited a survey where, for those under 40, Biden outperformed Trump in the last election. Mr. Segelke's approach to the class was highly concerning to me, and the tacit support implied by speaking under the CES name calls for him to act in a more appropriate manner. While I am not in that under 40 group, I see concern in my work with YSAs in our area that have political or other beliefs that differ from some of our older members. I offer that the approach presented by our church leaders focuses on members being free to choose without any expectation or litmus test. In that regard, I was extremely disappointed by Mr. Segelke and some other speakers when they chose to present material in a manner unbefitting such counsel.",negative,negative

It would have been comforting if we could have spoken to an Education Werk employee. It was at 4:30 pm on Saturday when I tried to reach your staff.

My suggestion is to provide an after hours phone number on your Education Week paperwork l for those who set up arrival times on the weekend. It would have helped us.

I am sure it is a correlation issue, but couldn't slides be available online. Handouts were offered years ago. Having slides available would enhance the whole experience.

Worst case, why not have a dance night featuring dances with different musical genres: Ballroom, Swing/40's, Pop, etc.  3. Roster visibility.  This could be opt in.  I didn't find out until I got back that one of my work colleagues was attending.  It would be good for networking with old acquaintances.  4. For further reading.

2048,Utah,5,"Having access to watch the classes virtually  after the week is over. With your purchased ticket would be access to the classes on-line. Also, with the classes you attend, you could have access to the slides from the class. It would make it so much easier to take notes, more enjoyable to be able to listen to the information given instead of stressing about getting pictures of every slide, and also make the class run smoother when you don't have students asking the presenter to go back a slide or two in order for them to take a picture. It's disrupting.  The following lecture series were highlights of my week. Please invite them back!   The Rich Mind, Poor Mind by Thomas Seneca. The Spiritual Physics by Aaron Franklin.  Shepherding Your Child in a Sex-Saturated World by Crystal Bowman Marriage Matters by Steven Eastmond Come Unto Christ by Scott L. Anderson Keep it Simple by Tana S. Page  The following instructors were NOT well-suited for education week. Please do not ask them to return.  Blaine F. Stewart--His lecture series was on Agency. I left the first class feeling terrible, like I had no power to make decisions and that my life was actually being micro-managed based on the covenants I decide to make. Let me say that I have a very strong testimony, so it didn't shake me at all doctrinally, but his content did make me feel like I was a cog in a wheel, rather than being able to steer that wheel. Also, he is old fashioned and very dated in his approach to homosexuality and shared his opinions on those matters openly with ""side comments"" throughout his lecture. To be honest, I don't think he even knew he was being offensive with what he was saying, which kind of made it worse. In addition, there was someone who made a comment in his class and in response, he was rude and condescending to that person. I felt embarrassed for not only him, but the person who made the comment as well. I attended his first class because the content interested me, but I did not return after that. It was a very uncomfortable class.  Kimberly Parry--The title of her class interested me, but it was an absolute complete waste of my time. She spent the first 20 minutes of the class trying to drill in the punch line from a joke she had made. She was self deprecating and used humor as a way to bouy herself  up through people's laughter, rather than using it as a tool to help her presentation hit home.  It felt like she was trying to be a stand up comedian. She was name dropping and inflating her ego every few minutes or so. There was NO content to her slides or material. I was so disappointed because not only did I really want to know more about what her class series described and there was nothing to take away from it, but I also wasted the hour not being able to go to another class of interest. It was obvious that she was very self-conscious, had imposter syndrome, and felt the need to prove to everyone in her class why she was qualified to be up there teaching. Sadly, in an effort to prove her qualifications, she did more than disprove them, she killed them. I know this is a harsh review, but really, the class was terrible. I didn't return to any of her lectures again.  I like the idea of having a TEDtalk series....where instructors have 15 minutes to make their points and hone their presentations to be concise, informationally potent, and really enjoyable to listen to. This could possibly be in the Marriot Center, so people who can't move well or get to classes easily could be able to sit there and enjoy the presentations. It would also benefit those who are coming for really concentrated presentations where the information is easily presented and easily ingested by the listener. It would also help the presenters as well with being more focused in their material and creating a more streamlined approach to what they are hoping to get out to their audience. ",negative,disgust

However, I believe the experience could be further enriched by incorporating a broader range of class topics that address everyday responsibilities and current societal issues, all through a gospel lens.  For example, more classes on financial planning, mental health, leadership, interfaith dialogue, business-building, cultural responsibilities, environmental stewardship, and interpersonal skills could be invaluable. These subjects are deeply relevant to our daily lives and could benefit greatly from the perspective offered by the Book of Mormon.  Additionally, while some of these types of classes were available, they were often located in buildings on the periphery of campus, making them less accessible to many attendees. Distributing these classes more evenly across campus could enhance participation and engagement.  I also propose the introduction of more unconventional and unique classes that connect religious principles with modern-day interests. For instance, courses like ""The Spirituality of Music Genres,"" ""The Gospel According to Pop Culture,"" or even something more playful like ""Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse: A Metaphor for Spiritual Preparedness"" could attract a wide audience. Hands-on classes such as an ""Escape Room: Book of Mormon Edition"" could also provide interactive and memorable learning experiences.  Lastly, expanding the discussion of current issues in the context of the Book of Mormon could be profoundly impactful. Offering more classes that address topics like homelessness, environmental stewardship, and addiction, framed within the gospel, would not only resonate with many but also provide timely and relevant teachings.  These suggestions are intended to complement the excellent offerings already in place, making Education Week even more diverse and inclusive.",positive,trust

My roomate was a really nice guy, but our sleeping patterns and such didn't match and he was pretty noisy in the morning for a long time (plus he locked himself out in the middle of the night once and had to bang on the door to wake me up). I have a hard time falling back asleep once I wake up, so all of this led to a not great experience for the first couple of days. He went home partway through, and after that the experience was amazing.  Something else that could help would be getting bigger rooms for those speakers that had to have overflow rooms (e.g. Avram Shannon, Kerry Muhlestein, Joseph Spencer).  Oh, and having more healthy food available on campus. The vast majority of the options are basically fast food. My body was feeling kinda gross toward the end of the week.  Otherwise, a lot of it is down to personal preference - having certain speakers closer together, not having certain speakers overlap, etc. There were a few panels I didn't get to see because they overlapped - it felt like the speakers I wanted to see were all sort of concentrated in the same hours, so I ended up having a packed schedule from about 9:50 to 4:05, but then I didn't have much to go to in the evenings.",negative,fear

That made everyone trying to get in at the same time to eat, making long lines and long waits. The food was kind of repetitive throughout the week. Desserts ran out fast, leaving only a couple of choices (rice crispy treats? Lots of those leftover daily, yet everyday there they were again.)  The cashiers were new, and in training. They had trouble with simple questions and scanning cards. The dinner hours were printed in the Ed Week booklet as 3 different times. Confusing everyone. We were told by we could purchase dining cards at the cannon dining room at dinner Sunday night. The cashiers told us they had no cards to sell.!!  What? Even the Cannon Center Information Desk told us to buy them there at dinner!    It seemed nobody could answer our questions. In past years the Cannon put a poster outside the door with a menu. Nothing this year. You had to pay your $14.99 without even knowing what food they were serving. Not very good business sense. Once inside, some members of our group realized they could only eat the burger (dietary restrictions). They commented that $14.99 was quite an expensive burger!!

2537,Washington,5,"For some of the popular speakers like brother eggit and sister boyak I found myself struggling to get a seat, even in the Overflow rooms. I don't know how many larger venues there are but it would be great if they spoke there. It can be frustrating to rush across campus hoping to see a speaker in person and then be placed in an overflow room. Also I saw that some people were taking the class before so they could get a good seat for the next class. Maybe it would be more fair if the room was emptied so the people who had been standing outside in line waiting to be seated had an opportunity to get a good seat also. One big frustration I had was with the badges. My friend forgot her badge one day and instead of going to her class she had to get another badge. She is disabled and this was a hardship. She chose to do this because she felt she wouldn't be let into the class. The volunteers seem a little power hungry where badges are concerned. I have to wonder who is breaking into education week and if they are shouldn't we let them in because they need it. I think most people have their badges on and you can see that they are clearly apart of this event but maybe if they don't they shouldn't be harassed. The shuttles that were provided were really helpful but took a lot of time and didn't always get people as close as they needed to be, speaking for my disabled friend. It might be nice to have some of the small golf carts helping people also. We stayed in human Halls and we're grateful to have a refrigerator but we would have stayed in Heritage Halls if we had been able to use the kitchen. I would have even paid a little bit more happily. I understand the day we check out kids are checking in and cleaning the kitchen could be a hardship but eating out gets a little tiresome all week. One more thing that I think would be helpful is when we are reading the descriptions of the classes this is how we decide where to go and I found myself in classes where they either barely touched on the topic or didn't really speak about it at all. If the daily descriptions could be relied on I would find that more helpful. Overall the week really was excellent and I am always strengthened and uplifted when attending education week.

2610,Illinois,5,"A few improvements in the mobile app would be very helpful. Specifically: 1--Include the series titles in the details for each class. It was a little confusing to review the printed booklet where series titles were featured and then switch the mobile app which only showed specific class titles.  2--Reduce the clicks to add a class to your calendar by removing the ""Would you like a reminder?"" prompt. My suggestion is to make that a global setting that can be edited on a class-by-class basis once it's been added to the user's calendar.  3--Create the ability to add an entire series to your calendar. At three clicks per class (including the conflicting class warning) times four classes per series, the steps to add an entire series to your calendar requires a lot of clicking!  4--With many interesting choices occurring at the same time, I found the process of selecting class very overwhelming. While it is a ""good problem,"" I struggled to find an approach to making decisions. I was consistently wanting more information. For example:  a) How many years has the presenter taught at Education Week? b) How many other Education Week attendees have added the class to their calendar? c) What is the presenter's average rating from past Education Week sessions taught? (I realize this one is problematic, but it was really difficult to decide where to go when there a 6-8 classes that all seem interesting at the same time.) c) What is the capacity of the room in which the session is held? (From within the mobile app. I saw that information in the printed booklet and assumed that popular classes or presenters were strategically placed in the larger capacity rooms.) d) A 2-3 sentence abstract or description for each class. I noted that this is required in the proposal to teach and providing something more than just the series and class titles would really help to get a sense for what will be covered. e) A PDF of the presenter's slides and any other relevant class references. A quick glance of any slide content or related class materials would provide a sense for what will be covered.  5--Provide the class materials, most often a PDF of the slides but could include links to talks or books or other materials referenced, for download via the app and/or website. The constant taking of photos by attendees is both distracting and inefficient. Even if this occurs shortly after the event to minimize the administrative burden from last-minute changes by the presenters.   6--Normalize Marriott Center concession prices for the duration of Education Week.

There were some that I would have loved to attend but because they were so far north on campus (near MTC or in marriott center) it was too long of a walk for us to make without being completely exhausted when arrived.    In a few classes with well known speakers, there were people up front on the mic before it started telling people to sit down or they would give your seat away which made it difficult for my aging body, especially after we had just sat there for an hour in the previous class and needed some time to move our muscles that had gone to sleep.   Even if we were standing in front of our own seat, we were told we had to sit down for another 10 minutes before we could get up to use the restroom or stretch.  We are all mostly adults and can figure out how to find our own seats without spending 20 minutes listening to something micromanage the audience the whole break (Jared Halvorsen's class in particular) to point out seats for those looking.  Seems like you should be able to leave a personal item on the seat next to your companion and not be threatened that it would be moved by the staff if you went to the bathroom.  The lines for the bathrooms are usually long so only having 10 minutes or less to go after you have been forced to stay in your seats for an extra 10-15 minutes wasn't enough time.    Probably just giving the more popular speakers a bigger room (like the JSB auditorium) to house more people (that doesn't require a long walk to the Marriott center) would solve some of those problems.

In the dyslexia class I attended, the presenter did not share scriptures but the way she spoke about those with dyslexia expressed so much love. She helped all of us see those with learning disabilities the way God sees them. It wasn't a surprise when she concluded her presentation in God's name because I had felt the Holy Ghost the whole time she was talking about how to give assessments for dyslexia. Amazing!

Please offer the option of having attendees scan a QR code before the presentation - which would allow them to access all of the slides, rather than taking photos.   And for those not willing to use a QR code, at least have the presenter tell people when the slide is complete.  Lots of people were taking 5 photos along the way, not knowing when the slide was complete and worrying it would be taken down and they'd miss it.    ‚Ä¢  It's really hard to give up a class time for eating lunch, and the Marriott Center was the only venue that allows food during class.  What about a few more locations where you're allowed to eat while listening?  Or have class overflow options in food-okay locations.  ‚Ä¢  Loved that there were more ""grab and go"" food options!  And the lines moved pretty quickly, with a nice variety of menu choices.  I think even more of these would be great!  Food trucks on campus would be awesome!  ‚Ä¢  It is frustrating that so many classes were extremely full well in advance of the starting time.  The overflow option is great, and worked better this year than some that I attended last year, but it's not quite the same.  I want to be able to see the presenter and the slides.  Only one overflow screen showed both.    ‚Ä¢  Clearly ""The Chosen"" presentation was way more popular than expected.  With like 6 overflow rooms?  That one should have been in the Marriott Center.  Can he please come do that again?  We missed out when the room was always full.  ‚Ä¢ Can popular classes be offered more than once during the day?  It's rough when you only get one chance to see someone and it conflicts with something else or is too far away.  If presenters could do their class a couple of times, that would be great!   ‚Ä¢  Specify on the class schedule whether a class is ""self-standing"" or ""series.""  We did more bouncing around, and felt lost in a couple of classes when the presenter would assume you'd been there the previous day.  We would generally like more ""self-standing"" classes so you don't feel like you have to be in that same class every day, but can enjoy a wider variety of topics and presenters.   ‚Ä¢  The BYU employees and volunteer staff members are awesome.

This was not needed as the other volunteers were silently  pointing at available seating. I think she loved being ""large and in charge"". She was some sort of afternoon supervisor that said she had been volunteering for many years . It disrupted the music he was playing for us of the new versions of hymns as we were being seated. She was also VERY strict and on what you could and could not do and VERY rude to some as she walked around. This took away from the calm spirit of the class and the music he was playing. This is the only class in many year that I have seen this. She was very condescending.
